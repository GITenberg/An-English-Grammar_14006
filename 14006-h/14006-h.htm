<h3><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>PREFACE.</h3>
<p>Of making many English grammars there is no end; nor should
there be till theoretical scholarship and actual practice are more
happily wedded. In this field much valuable work has already been
accomplished; but it has been done largely by workers accustomed to
take the scholar's point of view, and their writings are addressed
rather to trained minds than to immature learners. To find an
advanced grammar unencumbered with hard words, abstruse thoughts,
and difficult principles, is not altogether an easy matter. These
things enhance the difficulty which an ordinary youth experiences
in grasping and assimilating the facts of grammar, and create a
distaste for the study. It is therefore the leading object of this
book to be both as scholarly and as practical as possible. In it
there is an attempt to present grammatical facts as simply, and to
lead the student to assimilate them as thoroughly, as possible, and
at the same time to do away with confusing difficulties as far as
may be.</p>
<p>To attain these ends it is necessary to keep ever in the
foreground the <i>real basis of grammar</i>; that is, good
literature. Abundant quotations from standard authors have been
given to show the student that he is dealing with the facts of the
language, and not with the theories of grammarians. It is also
suggested that in preparing written exercises the student use
English classics instead of "making up" sentences. But it is not
intended that the use of literary masterpieces for grammatical
purposes should supplant or even interfere with their proper use
and real value as works of art. It will, however, doubtless be
found helpful to alternate the regular reading and &aelig;sthetic
study of literature with a grammatical study, so that, while the
mind is being enriched and the artistic sense quickened, there may
also be the useful acquisition of arousing a keen observation of
all grammatical forms and usages. Now and then it has been deemed
best to omit explanations, and to withhold <a name="Page_4" id=
"Page_4"></a>personal preferences, in order that the student may,
by actual contact with the sources of grammatical laws, discover
for himself the better way in regarding given data. It is not the
grammarian's business to "correct:" it is simply to record and to
arrange the usages of language, and to point the way to the
arbiters of usage in all disputed cases. Free expression within the
lines of good usage should have widest range.</p>
<p>It has been our aim to make a grammar of as wide a scope as is
consistent with the proper definition of the word. Therefore, in
addition to recording and classifying the facts of language, we
have endeavored to attain two other objects,&mdash;to cultivate
mental skill and power, and to induce the student to prosecute
further studies in this field. It is not supposable that in so
delicate and difficult an undertaking there should be an entire
freedom from errors and oversights. We shall gratefully accept any
assistance in helping to correct mistakes.</p>
<p>Though endeavoring to get our material as much as possible at
first hand, and to make an independent use of it, we desire to
express our obligation to the following books and
articles:&mdash;</p>
<p>Meiklejohn's "English Language," Longmans' "School Grammar,"
West's "English Grammar," Bain's "Higher English Grammar" and
"Composition Grammar," Sweet's "Primer of Spoken English" and "New
English Grammar," etc., Hodgson's "Errors in the Use of English,"
Morris's "Elementary Lessons in Historical English Grammar,"
Lounsbury's "English Language," Champney's "History of English,"
Emerson's "History of the English Language," Kellner's "Historical
Outlines of English Syntax," Earle's "English Prose," and Matzner's
"Englische Grammatik." Allen's "Subjunctive Mood in English,"
Battler's articles on "Prepositions" in the "Anglia," and many
other valuable papers, have also been helpful and suggestive.</p>
<p>We desire to express special thanks to Professor W.D. Mooney of
Wall &amp; Mooney's Battle-Ground Academy, Franklin, Tenn., for a
critical examination of the first draft of the manuscript, and to
Professor Jno. M. Webb of Webb Bros. School, Bell Buckle, Tenn.,
and Professor W.R. Garrett of the University of Nashville, for many
valuable suggestions and helpful criticism.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><a name="INTRODUCTION" id=
"INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>So many slighting remarks have been made of late on the use of
teaching grammar as compared with teaching science, that it is
plain the fact has been lost sight of that grammar is itself a
science. The object we have, or should have, in teaching science,
is not to fill a child's mind with a vast number of facts that may
or may not prove useful to him hereafter, but to draw out and
exercise his powers of observation, and to show him how to make use
of what he observes.... And here the teacher of grammar has a great
advantage over the teacher of other sciences, in that the facts he
has to call attention to lie ready at hand for every pupil to
observe without the use of apparatus of any kind while the use of
them also lies within the personal experience of every
one.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dr Richard Morris.</span></p>
<p>The proper study of a language is an intellectual discipline of
the highest order. If I except discussions on the comparative
merits of Popery and Protestantism, English grammar was the most
important discipline of my boyhood.<span class="smcap">&mdash;John
Tyndall.</span></p>
<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><b>INTRODUCTION.</b></p>
<p>What various opinions writers on English grammar have given in
answer to the question, <i>What is grammar?</i> may be shown by the
following&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definitions of grammar.</i></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>English grammar is a description of the usages of the English
language by good speakers and writers of the present
day.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Whitney</span></p>
<p>A description of account of the nature, build, constitution, or
make of a language is called its grammar<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Meiklejohn</span></p>
<p>Grammar teaches the laws of language, and the right method of
using it in speaking and writing.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Patterson</span></p>
<p>Grammar is the science of <i>letter</i>; hence the science of
using words correctly.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Abbott</span></p>
<p>The English word <i>grammar</i> relates only to the laws which
govern the significant forms of words, and the construction of the
sentence.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Richard Grant White</span></p>
</div>
<p>These are sufficient to suggest several distinct notions about
English grammar&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Synopsis of the above.</i></div>
<p>(1) It makes rules to tell us how to use words.</p>
<p>(2) It is a record of usage which we ought to follow.</p>
<p>(3) It is concerned with the <i>forms</i> of the language.</p>
<p>(4) English <i>has</i> no grammar in the sense of forms, or
inflections, but takes account merely of the nature and the uses of
words in sentences.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The older idea and its origin.</i></div>
<p>Fierce discussions have raged over these opinions, and numerous
works have been written to uphold the theories. The first of them
remained popular for a very long time. It originated from <a name=
"Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>the etymology of the word <i>grammar</i>
(Greek <i>gramma</i>, writing, a letter), and from an effort to
build up a treatise on English grammar by using classical grammar
as a model.</p>
<p>Perhaps a combination of (1) and (3) has been still more
popular, though there has been vastly more classification than
there are forms.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The opposite view</i>.</div>
<p>During recent years, (2) and (4) have been gaining ground, but
they have had hard work to displace the older and more popular
theories. It is insisted by many that the student's time should be
used in studying general literature, and thus learning the fluent
and correct use of his mother tongue. It is also insisted that the
study and discussion of forms and inflections is an inexcusable
imitation of classical treatises.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The difficulty</i>.</div>
<p>Which view shall the student of English accept? Before this is
answered, we should decide whether some one of the above theories
must be taken as the right one, and the rest disregarded.</p>
<p>The real reason for the diversity of views is a confusion of two
distinct things,&mdash;what the <i>definition</i> of grammar should
be, and what the <i>purpose</i> of grammar should be.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The material of grammar</i>.</div>
<p>The province of English grammar is, rightly considered, wider
than is indicated by any one of the above definitions; and the
student ought to have a clear idea of the ground to be covered.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Few inflections</i>.</div>
<p>It must be admitted that the language has very few inflections
at present, as compared with Latin or Greek; so that a small
grammar will hold them all.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Making rules is risky</i>.</div>
<p>It is also evident, to those who have studied the <a name=
"Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>language historically, that it is very
hazardous to make rules in grammar: what is at present regarded as
correct may not be so twenty years from now, even if our rules are
founded on the keenest scrutiny of the "standard" writers of our
time. Usage is varied as our way of thinking changes. In Chaucer's
time two or three negatives were used to strengthen a negation; as,
"Ther <i>nas no</i> man <i>nowher</i> so vertuous" (There never was
no man nowhere so virtuous). And Shakespeare used good English when
he said <i>more elder</i> ("Merchant of Venice") and <i>most
unkindest</i> ("Julius C&aelig;sar"); but this is bad English
now.</p>
<p>If, however, we have tabulated the inflections of the language,
and stated what syntax is the most used in certain troublesome
places, there is still much for the grammarian to do.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A broader view</i>.</div>
<p>Surely our noble language, with its enormous vocabulary, its
peculiar and abundant idioms, its numerous periphrastic forms to
express every possible shade of meaning, is worthy of serious
study, apart from the mere memorizing of inflections and
formulation of rules.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mental training. An &aelig;sthetic
benefit.</i></div>
<p>Grammar is eminently a means of mental training; and while it
will train the student in subtle and acute reasoning, it will at
the same time, if rightly presented, lay the foundation of a keen
observation and a correct literary taste. The continued contact
with the highest thoughts of the best minds will create a thirst
for the "well of English undefiled."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>What grammar is</i>.</div>
<p>Coming back, then, from the question, <i>What ground should
grammar cover?</i> we come to answer <a name="Page_12" id=
"Page_12"></a>the question, <i>What should grammar teach?</i> and
we give as an answer the definition,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>English grammar is the science which treats of the nature of
words, their forms, and their uses and relations in the
sentence</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The work it will cover.</i></div>
<p>This will take in the usual divisions, "The Parts of Speech"
(with their inflections), "Analysis," and "Syntax." It will also
require a discussion of any points that will clear up difficulties,
assist the classification of kindred expressions, or draw the
attention of the student to everyday idioms and phrases, and thus
incite his observation.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Authority as a basis</i>.</div>
<p>A few words here as to the <i>authority</i> upon which grammar
rests.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Literary English</i>.</div>
<p>The statements given will be substantiated by quotations from
the leading or "standard" literature of modern times; that is, from
the eighteenth century on. This <i>literary English</i> is
considered the foundation on which grammar must rest.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Spoken English</i>.</div>
<p>Here and there also will be quoted words and phrases from
<i>spoken</i> or <i>colloquial English</i>, by which is meant the
free, unstudied expressions of ordinary conversation and
communication among intelligent people.</p>
<p>These quotations will often throw light on obscure
constructions, since they preserve turns of expressions that have
long since perished from the literary or standard English.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Vulgar English</i>.</div>
<p>Occasionally, too, reference will be made to <i>vulgar
English,</i>&mdash;the speech of the uneducated and
ignorant,&mdash;which will serve to illustrate points of syntax
once correct, or standard, but now undoubtedly bad grammar.</p>
<p><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>The following pages will
cover, then, three divisions:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>Part I. The Parts of Speech, and Inflections.</p>
<p>Part II. Analysis of Sentences.</p>
<p>Part III. The Uses of Words, or Syntax.</p>
</div>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="PART_I" id="PART_I"></a><a name="Page_16" id=
"Page_16"></a>PART I.</h2>
<h3><i>THE PARTS OF SPEECH</i>.</h3>
<h2><a name="NOUNS" id="NOUNS"></a><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17"></a><b>NOUNS.</b></h2>
<p><span class="sn"><b>1.</b></span> In the more simple
<i>state</i> of the <i>Arabs</i>, the <i>nation</i> is free,
because each of her <i>sons</i> disdains a base <i>submission</i>
to the <i>will</i> of a <i>master</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Gibbon.</span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Name words</i></div>
<p>By examining this sentence we notice several words used as
names. The plainest name is <i>Arabs</i>, which belongs to a
people; but, besides this one, the words <i>sons</i> and
<i>master</i> name objects, and may belong to any of those objects.
The words <i>state, submission,</i> and <i>will</i> are evidently
names of a different kind, as they stand for ideas, not objects;
and the word <i>nation</i> stands for a whole group.</p>
<p>When the meaning of each of these words has once been
understood, the word naming it will always call up the thing or
idea itself. Such words are called <b>nouns</b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>2.</b></span> A noun is a name word,
representing directly to the mind an object, substance, or
idea.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Classes of nouns</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>3.</b></span> Nouns are classified as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Proper.</b><br />
<br />
(2) <b>Common.</b> (a) CLASS NAMES: i. Individual.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">ii. Collective.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">(b) MATERIAL.</span><br />
<br />
(3) <b>Abstract.</b> (a) ATTRIBUTE.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">(b) VERBAL</span><br /></p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><i>Names
for special objects.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>4.</b></span> A <b>proper noun</b> is a name
applied to a particular object, whether person, place, or
thing.</p>
<p>It specializes or limits the thing to which it is applied,
reducing it to a narrow application. Thus, <i>city</i> is a word
applied to any one of its kind; but <i>Chicago</i> names one city,
and fixes the attention upon that particular city. <i>King</i> may
be applied to any ruler of a kingdom, but <i>Alfred the Great</i>
is the name of one king only.</p>
<p>The word <i>proper</i> is from a Latin word meaning <i>limited,
belonging to one</i>. This does not imply, however, that a proper
name can be applied to only one object, but that each time such a
name is applied it is fixed or proper to that object. Even if there
are several Bostons or Manchesters, the name of each is an
individual or proper name.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Name for any individual of a
class.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>5.</b></span> A <b>common noun</b> is a name
possessed by <i>any</i> one of a class of persons, animals, or
things.</p>
<p><i>Common</i>, as here used, is from a Latin word which means
<i>general, possessed by all</i>.</p>
<p>For instance, <i>road</i> is a word that names <i>any</i>
highway outside of cities; <i>wagon</i> is a term that names
<i>any</i> vehicle of a certain kind used for hauling: the words
are of the widest application. We may say, <i>the man here</i>, or
<i>the man in front of you</i>, but the word <i>man</i> is here
hedged in by other words or word groups: the name itself is of
general application.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Name for a group or collection of
objects.</i></div>
<p>Besides considering persons, animals, and things separately, we
may think of them in groups, and appropriate names to the
groups.</p>
<p><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>Thus, men in groups may be
called a <i>crowd</i>, or a <i>mob</i>, a <i>committee</i>, or a
<i>council</i>, or a <i>congress</i>, etc.</p>
<p>These are called <b>COLLECTIVE NOUNS</b>. They properly belong
under common nouns, because each group is considered as a unit, and
the name applied to it belongs to any group of its class.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Names for things thought of in
mass.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>6.</b></span> The definition given for
common nouns applies more strictly to class nouns. It may, however,
be correctly used for another group of nouns detailed below; for
they are common nouns in the sense that the names apply to <i>every
particle of similar substance</i>, instead of to each individual or
separate object.</p>
<p>They are called <b>MATERIAL NOUNS</b>. Such are <i>glass</i>,
<i>iron</i>, <i>clay</i>, <i>frost</i>, <i>rain</i>, <i>snow</i>,
<i>wheat</i>, <i>wine</i>, <i>tea</i>, <i>sugar</i>, etc.</p>
<p>They may be placed in groups as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The metals: <i>iron</i>, <i>gold</i>, <i>platinum</i>,
etc.</p>
<p>(2) Products spoken of in bulk: <i>tea</i>, <i>sugar</i>,
<i>rice</i>, <i>wheat</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Geological bodies: <i>mud</i>, <i>sand</i>, <i>granite</i>,
<i>rock</i>, <i>stone</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Natural phenomena: <i>rain</i>, <i>dew</i>, <i>cloud</i>,
<i>frost</i>, <i>mist</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Various manufactures: <i>cloth</i> (and the different kinds
of cloth), <i>potash</i>, <i>soap</i>, <i>rubber</i>, <i>paint</i>,
<i>celluloid</i>, etc.</p>
<p><b>7. NOTE.</b>&mdash;There are some nouns, such as <i>sun</i>,
<i>moon</i>, <i>earth</i>, which seem to be the names of particular
individual objects, but which are not called proper names.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><i>Words
naturally of limited application not proper.</i></div>
<p>The reason is, that in proper names the intention is <i>to
exclude</i> all other individuals of the same class, and fasten a
special name to the object considered, as in calling a city
<i>Cincinnati</i>; but in the words <i>sun</i>, <i>earth</i>, etc.,
there is no such intention. If several bodies like the center of
our solar system are known, they also are called <i>suns</i> by a
natural extension of the term: so with the words <i>earth</i>,
<i>world</i>, etc. They remain common class names.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Names of ideas, not things.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>8.</b></span> <b>Abstract nouns</b> are
names of qualities, conditions, or actions, considered abstractly,
or apart from their natural connection.</p>
<p>When we speak of a <i>wise man</i>, we recognize in him an
attribute or quality. If we wish to think simply of that quality
without describing the person, we speak of the <i>wisdom</i> of the
man. The quality is still there as much as before, but it is taken
merely as a name. So <i>poverty</i> would express the condition of
a poor person; <i>proof</i> means the act of proving, or that which
shows a thing has been proved; and so on.</p>
<p>Again, we may say, "<i>Painting</i> is a fine art,"
"<i>Learning</i> is hard to acquire," "a man of
<i>understanding</i>."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>9.</b></span> There are two chief divisions
of abstract nouns:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) ATTRIBUTE NOUNS, expressing attributes or qualities.</p>
<p>(2) VERBAL NOUNS, expressing state, condition, or action.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Attribute abstract nouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>10.</b></span> The ATTRIBUTE ABSTRACT NOUNS
are derived from adjectives and from common nouns. Thus, <a name=
"Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>(1) <i>prudence</i> from <i>prudent</i>,
<i>height</i> from <i>high</i>, <i>redness</i> from <i>red</i>,
<i>stupidity</i> from <i>stupid</i>, etc.; (2) <i>peerage</i> from
<i>peer</i>, <i>childhood</i> from <i>child</i>, <i>mastery</i>
from <i>master</i>, <i>kingship</i> from <i>king</i>, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Verbal abstract nouns.</i></div>
<p><b>II.</b> The VERBAL ABSTRACT NOUNS Originate in verbs, as
their name implies. They may be&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Of the same form as the simple verb. The verb, by altering
its function, is used as a noun; as in the expressions, "a long
<i>run</i>" "a bold <i>move</i>," "a brisk <i>walk</i>."</p>
<p>(2) Derived from verbs by changing the ending or adding a
suffix: <i>motion</i> from <i>move</i>, <i>speech</i> from
<i>speak</i>, <i>theft</i> from <i>thieve</i>, <i>action</i> from
<i>act</i>, <i>service</i> from <i>serve</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution.</i></div>
<p>(3) Derived from verbs by adding <i>-ing</i> to the simple verb.
It must be remembered that these words are <i>free from any verbal
function</i>. They cannot govern a word, and they cannot
<i>express</i> action, but are merely <i>names</i> of actions. They
are only the husks of verbs, and are to be rigidly distinguished
from <i>gerunds</i> (Secs. 272, 273).</p>
<p>To avoid difficulty, study carefully these examples:</p>
<p>The best thoughts and <i>sayings</i> of the Greeks; the moon
caused fearful <i>forebodings</i>; in the <i>beginning</i> of his
life; he spread his <i>blessings</i> over the land; the great
Puritan <i>awakening</i>; our birth is but a sleep and a
<i>forgetting</i>; a <i>wedding</i> or a festival; the rude
<i>drawings</i> of the book; masterpieces of the Socratic
<i>reasoning</i>; the <i>teachings</i> of the High Spirit; those
opinions and <i>feelings</i>; there is time for such
<i>reasonings</i>; the <i>well-being</i> of her subjects; her
<i>longing</i> for their favor; <i>feelings</i> which their
original <i>meaning</i> will by no means justify; the main
<i>bearings</i> of this matter.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_22" id=
"Page_22"></a><i>Underived abstract nouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>12.</b></span> Some abstract nouns were not
derived from any other part of speech, but were framed directly for
the expression of certain ideas or phenomena. Such are
<i>beauty</i>, <i>joy</i>, <i>hope</i>, <i>ease</i>, <i>energy</i>;
<i>day</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>summer</i>, <i>winter</i>;
<i>shadow</i>, <i>lightning</i>, <i>thunder</i>, etc.</p>
<p>The adjectives or verbs corresponding to these are either
themselves derived from the nouns or are totally different words;
as <i>glad</i>&mdash;<i>joy</i>, <i>hopeful</i>&mdash;<i>hope</i>,
etc.</p>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><b>SPECIAL USES OF
NOUNS.</b></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Nouns change by use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>13.</b></span> By being used so as to vary
their usual meaning, nouns of one class may be made to approach
another class, or to go over to it entirely. Since words alter
their meaning so rapidly by a widening or narrowing of their
application, we shall find numerous examples of this shifting from
class to class; but most of them are in the following groups. For
further discussion see the remarks on articles (p. 119).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Proper names transferred to common
use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>14.</b></span> <b>Proper nouns are used as
common</b> in either of two ways:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>The origin of a thing is used for the thing itself</i>:
that is, the name of the inventor may be applied to the thing
invented, as a <i>davy</i>, meaning the miner's lamp invented by
Sir Humphry Davy; the <i>guillotine</i>, from the name of Dr.
Guillotin, who was its inventor. Or the name of the country or city
from which an article is derived is used for the article: as
<i>china</i>, from China; <i>arras</i>, from a town in France;
<i>port</i> (wine), from Oporto, in Portugal; <i>levant</i> and
<i>morocco</i> (leather).</p>
<p>Some of this class have become worn by use so that at present we
can scarcely discover the derivation from the form of the word; for
example, the word <i>port</i>, above. Others of similar character
are <i>calico</i>, from Calicut; <i>damask</i>, from Damascus;
<i>currants</i>, from Corinth; etc.</p>
<p>(2) <i>The name of a person or place noted for certain qualities
is transferred to any person or place possessing those
qualities</i>; thus,&mdash;<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Hercules and Samson were noted for their strength, and we call a
very strong man <i>a Hercules</i> or <i>a Samson</i>. Sodom was
famous for wickedness, and a similar place is called <i>a Sodom</i>
of sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>A Daniel</i> come to judgment!<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, <i>a
Locke</i>, <i>a Lavoisier</i>, <i>a Hutton</i>, <i>a Bentham</i>,
<i>a Fourier</i>, it imposes its classification on other men, and
lo! a new system.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Names for things in bulk altered for
separate portions.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>15.</b></span> <b>Material nouns may be used
as class names.</b> Instead of considering the whole body of
material of which certain uses are made, one can speak of
particular uses or phases of the substance; as&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Of individual objects</i> made from metals or other
substances capable of being wrought into various shapes. We know a
number of objects made of iron. The material <i>iron</i> embraces
the metal contained in them all; but we may say, "The cook made the
<i>irons</i> hot," referring to flat-irons; or, "The sailor was put
in <i>irons</i>" meaning chains of iron. So also we may speak of
<i>a glass</i> to drink from or to look into; <i>a steel</i> to
whet a knife on; <i>a rubber</i> for erasing marks; and so on.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Of classes</i> or <i>kinds</i> of the same substance.
These are the same in material, but differ in strength, purity,
etc. Hence it shortens speech to make the nouns plural, and say
<i>teas</i>, <i>tobaccos</i>, <i>paints</i>, <i>oils</i>,
<i>candies</i>, <i>clays</i>, <i>coals</i>.</p>
<p>(3) <i>By poetical use</i>, of certain words necessarily
singular in idea, which are made plural, or used as class nouns, as
in the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The lone and level <i>sands</i> stretch

</div>
<p>(4) <i>Of detached portions</i> of matter used as class names;
as <i>stones</i>, <i>slates</i>, <i>papers</i>, <i>tins</i>,
<i>clouds</i>, <i>mists</i>, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Personification of abstract
ideas.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>16.</b></span> <b>Abstract nouns are
frequently used as proper names</b> by being personified; that is,
the ideas are spoken of as residing in living beings. This is a
poetic usage, though not confined to verse.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A halfway class of words. Class nouns in
use, abstract in meaning.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>17.</b></span> <b>Abstract nouns are made
half abstract</b> by being spoken of in the plural.</p>
<p>They are not then pure abstract nouns, nor are they common class
nouns. For example, examine this:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

their power is founded not merely on <i>facts</i> which can be
communicated, but on <i>dispositions</i> which require to be
created.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When it is said that <i>art</i> differs from <i>science</i>,
that the power of art is founded on <i>fact</i>, that
<i>disposition</i> is the thing to be created, the words italicized
are pure abstract nouns; but in case <i>an art</i> or <i>a
science</i>, or <i>the arts</i> and <i>sciences</i>, be spoken of,
the <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>abstract idea is partly
lost. The words preceded by the article <i>a</i>, or made plural,
are still names of abstract ideas, not material things; but they
widen the application to separate kinds of <i>art</i> or different
branches of <i>science</i>. They are neither class nouns nor pure
abstract nouns: they are more properly called <i>half
abstract</i>.</p>
<p>Test this in the following sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>By ellipses, nouns used to
modify.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>18.</b></span> <b>Nouns used as descriptive

its meaning, or describe it; for example, "a <i>family</i>
quarrel," "a <i>New York</i> bank," "the <i>State Bank Tax</i>
bill," "a <i>morning</i> walk."</p>
<p>It is evident that these approach very near to the function of
adjectives. But it is better to consider them as nouns, for these
reasons: they do not give up their identity as nouns; they do not
express quality; they cannot be compared, as descriptive adjectives
are.</p>
<p>They are more like the possessive noun, which belongs to another
word, but is still a noun. They may be regarded as elliptical
expressions, meaning a walk <i>in the morning</i>, a bank <i>in New
York</i>, a bill <i>as to tax on the banks</i>, etc.</p>
<p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>NOTE.&mdash;If the
descriptive word be a <i>material</i> noun, it may be regarded as
changed to an adjective. The term "<i>gold</i> pen" conveys the

adjective.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The noun may borrow from any part of

<p><span class="sn"><b>19.</b></span> Owing to the scarcity of

<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_28" id=

<p><span class="sn"><b>20.</b></span> It is to be remembered,
however, that the above cases are shiftings of the <i>use</i>, of
words rather than of their <i>meaning</i>. We seldom find instances
of complete conversion of one part of speech into another.</p>
<p>When, in a sentence above, the terms <i>the great</i>, <i>the
wealthy</i>, are used, they are not names only: we have in mind the
idea of persons and the quality of being <i>great</i> or
<i>wealthy</i>. The words are used in the sentence where nouns are
used, but have an adjectival meaning.</p>
<p>In the other sentences, <i>why</i> and <i>wherefore</i>,
<i>When</i>, <i>Now</i>, and <i>Then</i>, are spoken of as if pure
nouns; but still the reader considers this not a natural
application of them as name words, but as a figure of speech.</p>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;These remarks do not apply, of course, to such words
as become pure nouns by use. There are many of these. The adjective
<i>good</i> has no claim on the noun <i>goods</i>; so, too, in
speaking of the <i>principal</i> of a school, or a state
<i>secret</i>, or a faithful <i>domestic</i>, or a <i>criminal</i>,
etc., the words are entirely independent of any adjective
force.</p>

<h3>INFLECTIONS OF NOUNS.</h3>
<h3>GENDER.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>What gender means in English. It is
founded on sex.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>21.</b></span> In Latin, Greek, German, and
many other languages, some general rules are given that names of
male beings are usually masculine, and names of females are usually
feminine. There are exceptions even to this general statement, but
not so in <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>English. Male beings
are, in English grammar, always masculine; female, always
feminine.</p>
<p>When, however, <i>inanimate</i> things are spoken of, these
languages are totally unlike our own in determining the gender of
words. For instance: in Latin, <i>hortus</i> (garden) is masculine,
<i>mensa</i> (table) is feminine, <i>corpus</i> (body) is neuter;
in German, <i>das Messer</i> (knife) is neuter, <i>der Tisch</i>
(table) is masculine, <i>die Gabel</i> (fork) is feminine.</p>
<p>The great difference is, that in English the gender follows the
<i>meaning</i> of the word, in other languages gender follows the
<i>form</i>; that is, in English, gender depends on <i>sex</i>: if
a thing spoken of is of the male sex, the <i>name</i> of it is
masculine; if of the female sex, the <i>name</i> of it is feminine.
Hence:</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>22.</b></span> <b>Gender</b> is the mode of
distinguishing sex by words, or additions to words.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>23.</b></span> It is evident from this that
English can have but two genders,&mdash;<b>masculine</b> and
<b>feminine</b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Gender nouns. Neuter nouns.</i></div>
<p>All nouns, then, must be divided into two principal
classes,&mdash;<b>gender nouns</b>, those distinguishing the sex of
the object; and <b>neuter nouns</b>, those which do not distinguish
sex, or names of things without life, and consequently without
sex.</p>
<p>Gender nouns include names of persons and some names of animals;
neuter nouns include some animals and all inanimate objects.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Some words either gender or neuter nouns,
according to use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>24.</b></span> Some words may be either
gender nouns or neuter nouns, according to their use. Thus, the
word <i>child</i> is neuter in the sentence, "A little <i>child</i>
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>shall lead them," but is
masculine in the sentence from Wordsworth,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i10">I have seen<br /></span>
<span>A curious <i>child</i> ... applying to <i>his</i>
ear<br /></span> <span>The convolutions of a smooth-lipped
shell.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Of animals, those with which man comes in contact often, or
which arouse his interest most, are named by gender nouns, as in
these sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Before the barn door strutted the gallant <i>cock</i>, that

<div class="sidenote"><i>No "common gender.</i>"</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>25.</b></span> According to the definition,
there can be no such thing as "common gender:" words either
distinguish sex (or the sex is distinguished by the context) or
else they do not distinguish sex.</p>
<p>If such words as <i>parent</i>, <i>servant</i>, <i>teacher</i>,
<i>ruler</i>, <i>relative</i>, <i>cousin</i>, <i>domestic</i>,
etc., do not show the sex to which the persons belong, they are
neuter words.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>26.</b></span> Put in convenient form, the

<b>Gender nouns</b> {<br />

"sn"><b>27.</b></span> The inflections for gender belong, of
course, only to masculine and feminine nouns. <i>Forms</i> would be
a more accurate word than <i>inflections</i>, since inflection
applies only to the <i>case</i> of nouns.</p>
<p>There are three ways to distinguish the genders:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) By prefixing a gender word to another word.</p>
<p>(2) By adding a suffix, generally to a masculine word.</p>
<p>(3) By using a different word for each gender.</p>
<h3>I. Gender shown by Prefixes.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Very few of class I.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>28.</b></span> Usually the gender words
<i>he</i> and <i>she</i> are prefixed to neuter words; as
<i>he-goat</i>&mdash;<i>she-goat</i>, <i>cock
sparrow</i>&mdash;<i>hen sparrow</i>,
<i>he-bear</i>&mdash;<i>she-bear</i>.</p>
<p>One feminine, <i>woman</i>, puts a prefix before the masculine
<i>man</i>. <i>Woman</i> is a short way of writing
<i>wifeman</i>.</p>
<h3>II. Gender shown by Suffixes.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>29.</b></span> By far the largest number of
gender words are those marked by suffixes. In this particular the
native endings have been largely supplanted by foreign
suffixes.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Native suffixes.</i></div>
<p>The <b>native suffixes</b> to indicate the feminine were
<i>-en</i> and <i>-ster</i>. These remain in <i>vixen</i> and
<i>spinster</i>, though both words have lost their original
meanings.</p>
<p>The word <i>vixen</i> was once used as the feminine of
<i>fox</i> by the Southern-English. For <i>fox</i> <a name=
"Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>they said <i>vox</i>; for <i>from</i>
they said <i>vram</i>; and for the older word <i>fat</i> they said
<i>vat</i>, as in <i>wine vat</i>. Hence <i>vixen</i> is for
<i>fyxen</i>, from the masculine <i>fox</i>.</p>
<p><i>Spinster</i> is a relic of a large class of words that
existed in Old and Middle English,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> but
have now lost their original force as feminines. The old masculine
answering to <i>spinster</i> was <i>spinner</i>; but
<i>spinster</i> has now no connection with it.</p>
<p>The <b>foreign suffixes</b> are of two kinds:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Foreign suffixes. Unaltered and little
used.</i></div>
<p>(1) Those belonging to borrowed words, as <i>czarina</i>,
<i>se&ntilde;orita</i>, <i>executrix</i>, <i>donna</i>. These are
attached to foreign words, and are never used for words recognized
as English.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Slightly changed and widely
used.</i></div>
<p>(2) That regarded as the standard or regular termination of the
feminine, <i>-ess</i> (French <i>esse</i>, Low Latin <i>issa</i>),
the one most used. The corresponding masculine may have the ending
<i>-er</i> (<i>-or</i>), but in most cases it has not. Whenever we
adopt a new masculine word, the feminine is formed by adding this
termination <i>-ess</i>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the <i>-ess</i> has been added to a word already
feminine by the ending <i>-ster</i>; as <i>seam-str-ess</i>,
<i>song-str-ess</i>. The ending <i>-ster</i> had then lost its
force as a feminine suffix; it has none now in the words
<i>huckster</i>, <i>gamester</i>, <i>trickster</i>,
<i>punster</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><i>Ending
of masculine not changed.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>30.</b></span> The ending <i>-ess</i> is
added to many words without changing the ending of the masculine;
as,&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>baron&mdash;baroness</li>
<li>count&mdash;countess</li>
<li>lion&mdash;lioness</li>
<li>Jew&mdash;Jewess</li>
<li>heir&mdash;heiress</li>
<li>host&mdash;hostess</li>
<li>priest&mdash;priestess</li>
<li>giant&mdash;giantess</li>
</ul>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Masculine ending dropped.</i></div>
<p>The masculine ending may be dropped before the feminine
<i>-ess</i> is added; as,&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>abbot&mdash;abbess</li>
<li>negro&mdash;negress</li>
<li>murderer&mdash;murderess</li>
<li>sorcerer&mdash;sorceress</li>
</ul>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Vowel dropped before adding</i>
-ess.</div>
<p>The feminine may discard a vowel which appears in the masculine;
as in&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>actor&mdash;actress</li>
<li>master&mdash;mistress</li>
<li>benefactor&mdash;benefactress</li>
<li>emperor&mdash;empress</li>
<li>tiger&mdash;tigress</li>
<li>enchanter&mdash;enchantress</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Empress</i> has been cut down from <i>emperice</i> (twelfth
century) and <i>emperesse</i> (thirteenth century), from Latin
<i>imperatricem</i>.</p>
<p><i>Master</i> and <i>mistress</i> were in Middle English
<i>maister</i>&mdash;<i>maistresse</i>, from the Old French
<i>maistre</i>&mdash;<i>maistresse</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>31.</b></span> When the older <i>-en</i> and
<i>-ster</i> went out of use as the distinctive mark of the
feminine, the ending <i>-ess</i>, from the French <i>-esse</i>,
sprang into a popularity much greater than at present.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Ending</i> -ess <i>less used now than
formerly.</i></div>
<p>Instead of saying <i>doctress</i>, <i>fosteress</i>,
<i>wagoness</i>, as was said in the sixteenth century, or
<i>servauntesse</i>, <i>teacheresse</i>, <i>neighboresse</i>,
<i>frendesse</i>, as in the fourteenth century, we have dispensed
with the ending <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>in many cases,
and either use a prefix word or leave the masculine to do work for
the feminine also.</p>
<p>Thus, we say <i>doctor</i> (masculine and feminine) or <i>woman
doctor</i>, <i>teacher</i> or <i>lady teacher</i>, <i>neighbor</i>
(masculine and feminine), etc. We frequently use such words as
<i>author</i>, <i>editor</i>, <i>chairman</i>, to represent persons
of either sex.</p>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;There is perhaps this distinction observed: when we
speak of a female <i>as an active agent</i> merely, we use the
masculine termination, as, "George Eliot is the <i>author</i> of
'Adam Bede;'" but when we speak purposely <i>to denote a
distinction from a male</i>, we use the feminine, as, "George Eliot
is an eminent <i>authoress</i>."</p>
<h3>III. Gender shown by Different Words.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>32.</b></span> In some of these pairs, the
feminine and the masculine are entirely different words; others
have in their origin the same root. Some of them have an
interesting history, and will be noted below:&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>bachelor&mdash;maid</li>
<li>boy&mdash;girl</li>
<li>brother&mdash;sister</li>
<li>drake&mdash;duck</li>
<li>earl&mdash;countess</li>
<li>father&mdash;mother</li>
<li>gander&mdash;goose</li>
<li>hart&mdash;roe</li>
<li>horse&mdash;mare</li>
<li>husband&mdash;wife</li>
<li>king&mdash;queen</li>
<li>lord&mdash;lady</li>
<li>wizard&mdash;witch</li>
<li>nephew&mdash;niece</li>
<li>ram&mdash;ewe</li>
<li>sir&mdash;madam</li>
<li>son&mdash;daughter</li>
<li>uncle&mdash;aunt</li>
<li>bull&mdash;cow</li>
<li>boar&mdash;sow</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Girl</b> originally meant a child of either sex, and was used
for male or female until about the fifteenth century.</p>
<p><b>Drake</b> is peculiar in that it is formed from a
corresponding feminine which is no longer used. It is not connected
historically with our word <i>duck</i>, <a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36"></a>but is derived from <i>ened</i> (duck) and an
obsolete suffix <i>rake</i> (king). Three letters of <i>ened</i>
have fallen away, leaving our word <i>drake</i>.</p>
<p><b>Gander</b> and <b>goose</b> were originally from the same
root word. <i>Goose</i> has various cognate forms in the languages
akin to English (German <i>Gans</i>, Icelandic <i>g&aacute;s</i>,
Danish <i>gaas</i>, etc.). The masculine was formed by adding
<i>-a</i>, the old sign of the masculine. This <i>gansa</i> was
modified into <i>gan-ra</i>, <i>gand-ra</i>, finally <i>gander</i>;
the <i>d</i> being inserted to make pronunciation easy, as in many
other words.</p>
<p><b>Mare</b>, in Old English <i>mere</i>, had the masculine
<i>mearh</i> (horse), but this has long been obsolete.</p>
<p><b>Husband</b> and <b>wife</b> are not connected in origin.
<i>Husband</i> is a Scandinavian word (Anglo-Saxon
<i>h&#363;sbonda</i> from Icelandic <i>h&uacute;s-b&oacute;ndi</i>,
probably meaning house dweller); <i>wife</i> was used in Old and
Middle English to mean woman in general.</p>
<p><b>King</b> and <b>queen</b> are said by some (Skeat, among
others) to be from the same root word, but the German etymologist
Kluge says they are not.</p>
<p><b>Lord</b> is said to be a worn-down form of the Old English
<i>hl&#257;f-weard</i> (loaf keeper), written <i>loverd</i>,
<i>lhauerd</i>, or <i>lauerd</i> in Middle English. <b>Lady</b> is
from <i>hl&oelig;&#772;&#772;fdige</i>
(<i>hl&oelig;&#772;&#772;f</i> meaning loaf, and <i>dige</i> being
of uncertain origin and meaning).</p>
<p><b>Witch</b> is the Old English <i>wicce</i>, but <b>wizard</b>
is from the Old French <i>guiscart</i> (prudent), not immediately
connected with <i>witch</i>, though both are ultimately from the
same root.</p>
<p><b>Sir</b> is worn down from the Old French <i>sire</i> (Latin
<i>senior</i>). <b>Madam</b> is the French <i>ma dame</i>, from
Latin <i>mea domina</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><i>Two
masculines from feminines.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>33.</b></span> Besides <i>gander</i> and
<i>drake</i>, there are two other masculine words that were formed
from the feminine:&mdash;</p>
<p><b>Bridegroom,</b> from Old English <i>bry&#772;d-guma</i>
(bride's man). The <i>r</i> in <i>groom</i> has crept in from
confusion with the word <i>groom</i>.</p>
<p><b>Widower,</b> from the weakening of the ending <i>-a</i> in
Old English to <i>-e</i> in Middle English. The older forms,
<i>widuwa</i>&mdash;<i>widuwe</i>, became identical, and a new
masculine ending was therefore added to distinguish the masculine
from the feminine (compare Middle English
<i>widuer</i>&mdash;<i>widewe</i>).</p>
<h3>Personification.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>34.</b></span> Just as abstract ideas are
personified (Sec. 16), material objects may be spoken of like
gender nouns; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"Now, where the swift <i>Rhone</i>
cleaves <i>his</i> way."<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Byron.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The <i>Sun</i> now rose upon the
right:<br /></span> <span>Out of the sea came
<i>he</i>.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Coleridge.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And haply the <i>Queen Moon</i> is on
<i>her</i> throne,<br /></span> <span>Clustered around by all her
starry Fays.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Keats.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span><i>Britannia</i> needs no
bulwarks,<br /></span> <span>No towers along the
steep;<br /></span> <span><i>Her</i> march is o'er the mountain
waves,<br /></span> <span><i>Her</i> home is on the
deep.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Campbell.</span></div>
</div>
<p>This is not exclusively a poetic use. In ordinary speech
personification is very frequent: the pilot speaks of his boat as
feminine; the engineer speaks so of his engine; etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Effect of personification.</i></div>
<p>In such cases the gender is marked by the pronoun, and not by
the form of the noun. But the fact that in English the distinction
of gender is <a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>confined to
difference of sex makes these departures more effective.</p>
<h3>NUMBER.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>35.</b></span> In nouns, number means the
mode of indicating whether we are speaking of one thing or of more
than one.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>36.</b></span> Our language has two
numbers,&mdash;<i>singular</i> and <i>plural</i>. The singular
number denotes that one thing is spoken of; the plural, more than
one.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>37.</b></span> There are three ways of
changing the singular form to the plural:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) By adding <i>-en</i>.</p>
<p>(2) By changing the root vowel.</p>
<p>(3) By adding <i>-s</i> (or <i>-es</i>).</p>
<p>The first two methods prevailed, together with the third, in Old
English, but in modern English <i>-s</i> or <i>-es</i> has come to
be the "standard" ending; that is, whenever we adopt a new word, we
make its plural by adding <i>-s</i> or <i>-es.</i></p>
<h3>I. Plurals formed by the Suffix <i>-en</i>.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The</i> -en <i>inflection.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>38.</b></span> This inflection remains only
in the word <b>oxen</b>, though it was quite common in Old and
Middle English; for instance, <i>eyen</i> (eyes), <i>treen</i>
(trees), <i>shoon</i> (shoes), which last is still used in Lowland
Scotch. <i>Hosen</i> is found in the King James version of the
Bible, and <i>housen</i> is still common in the provincial speech
in England.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>39.</b></span> But other words were
inflected afterwards, in imitation of the old words in <i>-en</i>
by making a double plural.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>-En
<i>inflection imitated by other words.</i></div>
<p><b>Brethren</b> has passed through three stages. The old plural
was <i>brothru</i>, then <i>brothre</i> or <i>brethre</i>, finally
<i>brethren</i>. The weakening of inflections led to this
addition.</p>
<p><b>Children</b> has passed through the same history, though the
intermediate form <i>childer</i> lasted till the seventeenth
century in literary English, and is still found in dialects;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"God bless me! so then, after all, you'll have a chance to see
your <i>childer</i> get up like, and get settled."<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Quoted By De Quincey.</span></p>
</div>
<p><b>Kine</b> is another double plural, but has now no
singular.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>In spite of wandering <i>kine</i> and other adverse
circumstance.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thoreau.</span></p>
</div>
<h3>II. Plurals formed by Vowel Change.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>40.</b></span> Examples of this inflection
are,&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>man&mdash;men</li>
<li>foot&mdash;feet</li>
<li>goose&mdash;geese</li>
<li>louse&mdash;lice</li>
<li>mouse&mdash;mice</li>
<li>tooth&mdash;teeth</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other words&mdash;as <i>book</i>, <i>turf</i>,
<i>wight</i>, <i>borough</i>&mdash;formerly had the same
inflection, but they now add the ending <i>-s</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>41.</b></span> Akin to this class are some
words, originally neuter, that have the singular and plural alike;
such as <i>deer</i>, <i>sheep</i>, <i>swine</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Other words following the same usage are, <i>pair</i>,
<i>brace</i>, <i>dozen</i>, after numerals (if not after numerals,
or if preceded by the prepositions <i>in</i>, <i>by</i>, etc, they
add <i>-s</i>): also <i>trout</i>, <i>salmon</i>; <i>head</i>,
<i>sail</i>; <i>cannon</i>; <i>heathen</i>, <i>folk</i>,
<i>people</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>The words <i>horse</i> and
<i>foot</i>, when they mean soldiery, retain the same form for
plural meaning; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The <i>foot</i> are fourscore
thousand,<br /></span> <span>The <i>horse</i> are thousands
ten.<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Lee marched over the mountain
wall,&mdash;<br /></span> <span>Over the mountains winding
down,<br /></span> <span><i>Horse</i> and <i>foot</i>, into
Frederick town.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Whittier.</span></div>
</div>
<h3>III. Plurals formed by Adding -s or -es.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>42.</b></span> Instead of <i>-s,</i> the
ending <i>-es</i> is added&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) If a word ends in a letter which cannot add <i>-s</i> and be
pronounced. Such are <i>box, cross, ditch, glass, lens, quartz</i>,
etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>-Es added in certain cases</i>.</div>
<p>If the word ends in a <i>sound</i> which cannot add <i>-s</i>, a
new syllable is made; as, <i>niche&mdash;niches, race&mdash;races,
house&mdash;houses, prize&mdash;prizes, chaise&mdash;chaises</i>,
etc.</p>
<p><i>-Es</i> is also added to a few words ending in -o, though
this sound combines readily with <i>-s</i>, and does not make an
extra syllable: <i>cargo&mdash;cargoes, negro&mdash;negroes,
hero&mdash;heroes, volcano&mdash;volcanoes</i>, etc.</p>
<p>Usage differs somewhat in other words of this class, some adding
<i>-s</i>, and some <i>-es</i>.</p>
<p>(2) If a word ends in <i>-y</i> preceded by a consonant (the
<i>y</i> being then changed to <i>i</i>); e.g., <i>fancies, allies,
daisies, fairies</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Words in -ies.</i></div>
<p>Formerly, however, these words ended in <i>-ie</i>, and the real
ending is therefore <i>-s</i>. Notice these from Chaucer
(fourteenth century):&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><i>Their
old form.</i></div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The <i>lilie</i> on hir stalke
grene.<br /></span> <span>Of <i>maladie</i> the which he hadde
endured.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>And these from Spenser (sixteenth century):&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Be well aware, quoth then that
<i>ladie</i> milde.<br /></span> <span>At last fair Hesperus in
highest <i>skie</i><br /></span> <span>Had spent his
lampe.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>(3) In the case of some <b>words ending in -<i>f</i> or
-<i>fe</i></b>, which have the plural in <i>-ves</i>:
<i>calf</i>&mdash;<i>calves</i>, <i>half</i>&mdash;<i>halves</i>,
<i>knife</i>&mdash;<i>knives</i>,
<i>shelf</i>&mdash;<i>shelves</i>, etc.</p>
<h3>Special Lists.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>43.</b></span> <b>Material nouns</b> and
<b>abstract nouns</b> are always singular. When such words take a

<p><span class="sn"><b>44.</b></span> <b>Proper nouns</b> are

<h3>CASE.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>55.</b></span> Case is an inflection or use
of a noun (or pronoun) to show its relation to other words in the
sentence.</p>
<p>In the sentence, "He sleeps in a felon's cell," the word
<i>felon's</i> modifies <i>cell</i>, and expresses a relation akin
to possession; <i>cell</i> has another relation, helping to express
the idea of place with the word <i>in</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>56.</b></span> In the general wearing-away
of inflections, the number of case forms has been greatly
reduced.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Only two</i> case forms.</div>
<p>There are now only two case forms of English nouns,&mdash;one
for the <i>nominative</i> and <i>objective</i>, one for the
<i>possessive</i>: consequently the matter of inflection is a very
easy thing to handle in learning about cases.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Reasons for speaking of</i> three cases
<i>of nouns</i>.</div>
<p>But there are reasons why grammars treat of <i>three</i> cases
of nouns when there are only two forms:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Because the relations of all words, whether inflected or
not, must be understood for purposes of analysis.</p>
<p>(2) Because pronouns still have three case forms as well as
three case relations.</p>
<p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class=
"sn"><b>57.</b></span> Nouns, then, may be said to have three
cases,&mdash;the <b>nominative</b>, the <b>objective</b>, and the
<b>possessive</b>.</p>
<h3>I. Uses of the Nominative.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>58.</b></span> The nominative case is used
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>As the subject of a verb</i>: "<i>Water</i> seeks its
level."</p>
<p>(2) <i>As a predicate noun</i>, completing a verb, and referring
to or explaining the subject: "A bent twig makes a crooked
<i>tree</i>."</p>
<p>(3) <i>In apposition</i> with some other nominative word, adding
to the meaning of that word: "The reaper <i>Death</i> with his
sickle keen."</p>
<p>(4) <i>In direct address</i>: "<i>Lord Angus</i>, thou hast
lied!"</p>
<p>(5) <i>With a participle in an absolute or independent
phrase</i> (there is some discussion whether this is a true
nominative): "The <i>work</i> done, they returned to their
homes."</p>
<p>(6) <i>With an infinitive in exclamations</i>: "<i>David</i> to
die!"</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Pick out the nouns in the nominative case, and tell which use of
the nominative each one has.</p>

<h3>II. Uses of the Objective.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>59.</b></span> The objective case is used as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>As the direct object of a verb</i>, naming the person or
thing directly receiving the action of the verb: "Woodman, spare
that <i>tree</i>!"</p>
<p>(2) <i>As the indirect object of a verb</i>, naming the person
or thing indirectly affected by the action of the verb: "Give the
<i>devil</i> his due."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Adverbially</i>, defining the action of a verb by
denoting <i>time</i>, <i>measure</i>, <i>distance</i>, etc. (in the
older stages of the language, this took the regular accusative
inflection): "Full <i>fathom</i> five thy father lies;" "Cowards
die many <i>times</i> before their deaths."</p>
<p>(4) <i>As the second object</i>, completing the verb, and thus
becoming part of the predicate in acting upon an object: "Time
makes the worst enemies <i>friends</i>;" "Thou makest the storm a
<i>calm</i>." In these sentences the real predicates are <i>makes
friends</i>, taking the object <i>enemies</i>, and being equivalent
to one verb, <i>reconciles</i>; and <i>makest a calm</i>, taking
the object <i>storm</i>, and meaning calmest. This is also called
the <i>predicate objective</i> or the <i>factitive object</i>.</p>
<p>(5) <i>As the object of a preposition</i>, the word toward which
the preposition points, and which it joins to another word: "He
must have a long spoon that would eat with the <i>devil</i>."</p>
<p><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>The preposition sometimes
takes the <i>possessive</i> case of a noun, as will be seen in Sec.
68.</p>
<p>(6) <i>In apposition with another objective</i>: "The opinions
of this junto were completely controlled by Nicholas Vedder, a
<i>patriarch</i> of the village, and <i>landlord</i> of the
inn."</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>

<p>4. But the flood came howling one day.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h3>III. Uses of the Possessive.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>60.</b></span> The possessive case always
modifies another word, expressed or understood. There are three
forms of possessive showing how a word is related in sense to the
modified word:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Appositional possessive</i>, as in these
expressions,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The blind old man of <i>Scio's</i> rocky isle.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Byron.</span></p>
<p>Beside a pumice isle in <i>Bai&aelig;'s</i> bay.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shelley.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>In these sentences the
phrases are equivalent to <i>of the rocky isle [of] Scio</i>, and
<i>in the bay [of] Bai&aelig;</i>, the possessive being really
equivalent here to an appositional objective. It is a poetic
expression, the equivalent phrase being used in prose.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Objective possessive</i>, as shown in the
sentences,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Ann Turner had taught her the secret before this last good lady
had been hanged for <i>Sir Thomas Overbury's</i>
murder.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>He passes to-day in building an air castle for to-morrow, or in
writing <i>yesterday's</i> elegy.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray</span></p>
</div>
<p>In these the possessives are equivalent to an objective after a
verbal expression: as, <i>for murdering Sir Thomas Overbury</i>;
<i>an elegy to commemorate yesterday</i>. For this reason the use
of the possessive here is called objective.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Subjective possessive</i>, the most common of all;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The unwearied sun, from day to
day,<br /></span> <span>Does his Creator's power
display.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Addison.</span></div>
</div>
<p>If this were expanded into <i>the power which his Creator
possesses</i>, the word <i>Creator</i> would be the subject of the
verb: hence it is called a subjective possessive.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>61.</b></span> This last-named possessive
expresses a variety of relations. <i>Possession</i> in some sense
is the most common. The kind of relation may usually be found by
expanding the possessive into an equivalent phrase: for example,
"<i>Winter's</i> rude tempests are gathering now" (i.e., tempests
that winter is likely to have); "His beard was of <a name="Page_51"
id="Page_51"></a><i>several days'</i> growth" (i.e., growth which
several days had developed); "The <i>forest's</i> leaping panther
shall yield his spotted hide" (i.e., the panther which the forest
hides); "Whoso sheddeth <i>man's</i> blood" (blood that man
possesses).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>How the possessive is formed.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>62.</b></span> As said before (Sec. 56),
there are only two case forms. One is the simple form of a word,
expressing the relations of nominative and objective; the other is
formed by adding <i>'s</i> to the simple form, making the
possessive singular. To form the possessive plural, only the
apostrophe is added if the plural nominative ends in <i>-s</i>; the
<i>'s</i> is added if the plural nominative does not end in
<i>-s</i>.</p>
<h3>Case Inflection.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Declension or inflection of
nouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>63.</b></span> The full declension of nouns
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A suggestion.</i></div>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;The difficulty that some students have in writing
the possessive plural would be lessened if they would remember
there are two steps to be taken:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Form the nominative plural according to Secs 39-53</p>
<p>(2) Follow the rule given in Sec. 62.</p>
<h3>Special Remarks on the Possessive Case.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Origin of the possessive with its
apostrophe.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>64.</b></span> In Old English a large number
of words had in the genitive case singular the ending <i>-es</i>;
in Middle English still more words took this ending: for example,
in Chaucer, "From every <i>schires</i> <a name="Page_52" id=
"Page_52"></a>ende," "Full worthi was he in his <i>lordes</i> werre
[war]," "at his <i>beddes</i> syde," "<i>mannes</i> herte [heart],"
etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A false theory.</i></div>
<p>By the end of the seventeenth century the present way of
indicating the possessive had become general. The use of the
apostrophe, however, was not then regarded as standing for the
omitted vowel of the genitive (as <i>lord's</i> for <i>lordes</i>):
by a false theory the ending was thought to be a contraction of
<i>his</i>, as schoolboys sometimes write, "George Jones <i>his</i>
book."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the apostrophe.</i></div>
<p>Though this opinion was untrue, the apostrophe has proved a
great convenience, since otherwise words with a plural in <i>-s</i>
would have three forms alike. To the eye all the forms are now
distinct, but to the ear all may be alike, and the connection must
tell us what form is intended.</p>
<p>The use of the apostrophe in the plural also began in the
seventeenth century, from thinking that <i>s</i> was not a
possessive sign, and from a desire to have distinct forms.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sometimes</i> s <i>is left out in the
possessive singular.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>65.</b></span> Occasionally the <i>s</i> is
dropped in the possessive singular if the word ends in a hissing
sound and another hissing sound follows, but the apostrophe remains
to mark the possessive; as, <i>for goodness' sake, Cervantes'
satirical work</i>.</p>
<p>In other cases the <i>s</i> is seldom omitted. Notice these
three examples from Thackeray's writings: "Harry ran upstairs to
his <i>mistress's</i> apartment;" "A postscript is added, as by the
<i>countess's</i> command;" "I saw what the <i>governess's</i>
views were of the matter."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53"></a><i>Possessive with compound expressions.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>66.</b></span> In compound expressions,
containing words in apposition, a word with a phrase, etc., the
possessive sign is usually last, though instances are found with
both appositional words marked.</p>
<p>Compare the following examples of literary usage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Do not the Miss Prys, my neighbors, know the amount of my
income, the items of my <i>son's</i>, <i>Captain Scrapegrace's</i>,
tailor's bill<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>The world's pomp and power sits there on this hand: on that,
stands up for God's truth one man, the <i>poor miner Hans
Luther's</i> son.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
<p>They invited me in the <i>emperor their master's</i>
name.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
<p>I had naturally possessed myself of <i>Richardson the
painter's</i> thick octavo volumes of notes on the "Paradise
Lost."&mdash;DE QUINCEY.</p>
<p>They will go to Sunday schools to teach classes of little
children the age of Methuselah or the dimensions of <i>Og the king
of Bashan's</i> bedstead.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Holmes.</span></p>
</div>
<p>More common still is the practice of turning the possessive into
an equivalent phrase; as, <i>in the name of the emperor their
master</i>, instead of <i>the emperor their master's name</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Possessive and no noun limited.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>67.</b></span> The possessive is sometimes
used without belonging to any noun in the sentence; some such word
as <i>house</i>, <i>store</i>, <i>church</i>, <i>dwelling</i>,
etc., being understood with it: for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Here at the <i>fruiterer's</i> the Madonna has a tabernacle of
fresh laurel leaves.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
<p>It is very common for people to say that they are disappointed
in the first sight of <i>St. Peter's</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
<p>I remember him in his cradle at <i>St. James's</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><i>The
double possessive.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>68.</b></span> A peculiar form, a double
possessive, has grown up and become a fixed idiom in modern
English.</p>
<p>In most cases, a possessive relation was expressed in Old
English by the inflection <i>-es</i>, corresponding to <i>'s</i>.
The same relation was expressed in French by a phrase corresponding
to <i>of</i> and its object. Both of these are now used side by
side; sometimes they are used together, as one modifier, making a
double possessive. For this there are several reasons:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Its advantages: Euphony</i>.</div>
<p>(1) When a word is modified by <i>a</i>, <i>the</i>,
<i>this</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>any</i>,
<i>each</i>, etc., and at the same time by a possessive noun, it is
distasteful to place the possessive before the modified noun, and
it would also alter the meaning: we place it after the modified
noun with <i>of</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Emphasis.</i></div>
<p>(2) It is more emphatic than the simple possessive, especially
when used with <i>this</i> or <i>that</i>, for it brings out the
modified word in strong relief.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Clearness.</i></div>
<p>(3) It prevents ambiguity. For example, in such a sentence as,
"This introduction <i>of Atterbury's</i> has all these advantages"
(Dr. Blair), the statement clearly means only one thing,&mdash;the
introduction which Atterbury made. If, however, we use the phrase
<i>of Atterbury</i>, the sentence <i>might</i> be understood as
just explained, or it might mean this act of introducing Atterbury.
(See also Sec. 87.)</p>
<p>The following are some instances of double
possessives:&mdash;</p>

she stands.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>

<h3>HOW TO PARSE NOUNS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>69.</b></span> <b>Parsing</b> a word is
putting together all the facts about its form and its relations to
other words in the sentence.</p>
<p>In parsing, some idioms&mdash;the double possessive, for
example&mdash;do not come under regular grammatical rules, and are
to be spoken of merely as idioms.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>70.</b></span> Hence, in parsing a noun, we
state,&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The class to which it belongs,&mdash;common, proper,
etc.</p>
<p>(2) Whether a neuter or a gender noun; if the latter, which
gender.</p>
<p>(3) Whether singular or plural number.</p>
<p>(4) Its office in the sentence, determining its case.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The correct method.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>71.</b></span> In parsing any word, the
following method should always be followed: tell the facts about
what the word <i>does</i>, then make the grammatical statements as
to its class, inflections, and relations.</p>
<h3>MODEL FOR PARSING.</h3>
<p>"What is bolder than a miller's neckcloth, which takes a thief
by the throat every morning?"</p>
<p><i>Miller's</i> is a name applied to every individual of its
class, hence it is a common noun; it is the name of a male being,
hence it is a gender noun, masculine; it denotes only one person,
therefore singu<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>lar number; it
expresses possession or ownership, and limits <i>neckcloth</i>,
therefore possessive case.</p>
<p><i>Neckcloth</i>, like <i>miller's</i>, is a common class noun;
it has no sex, therefore neuter; names one thing, therefore
singular number; subject of the verb <i>is</i> understood, and
therefore nominative case.</p>
<p><i>Thief</i> is a common class noun; the connection shows a male
is meant, therefore masculine gender; singular number; object of
the verb <i>takes</i>, hence objective case.</p>
<p><i>Throat</i> is neuter, of the same class and number as the
word <i>neckcloth</i>; it is the object of the preposition
<i>by</i>, hence it is objective case.</p>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;The preposition sometimes takes the possessive case
(see Sec. 68).</p>
<p><i>Morning</i> is like <i>throat</i> and <i>neckcloth</i> as to
class, gender, and number; as to case, it expresses time, has no
governing word, but is the adverbial objective.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Follow the model above in parsing all the nouns in the following
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. To raise a monument to departed worth is to perpetuate
virtue.</p>
<p>2. The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by
stealth, and to have it found out by accident.</p>
<p>3. An old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered serving man, a
fresh tapster.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>That in the captain's but a choleric
word,<br /></span> <span>Which in the soldier is flat
blasphemy.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>5. Now, blessings light on him that first invented ...
sleep!</p>
<p>6. Necker, financial minister to Louis XVI., and his daughter,
Madame de Sta&euml;l, were natives of Geneva.</p>
<p>7. He giveth his beloved sleep.<a name="Page_58" id=

<p>8. Time makes the worst enemies friends.</p>
<p>9. A few miles from this point, where the Rhone enters the lake,
stands the famous Castle of Chillon, connected with the shore by a
drawbridge,&mdash;palace, castle, and prison, all in one.</p>
<p>10.</p>

<h2><a name="PRONOUNS" id="PRONOUNS"></a><b>PRONOUNS.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The need of pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>72.</b></span> When we wish to speak of a
name several times in succession, it is clumsy and tiresome to
repeat the noun. For instance, instead of saying, "<i>The pupil</i>
will succeed in <i>the pupil's</i> efforts if <i>the pupil</i> is
ambitious," we improve the sentence by shortening it thus, "The
pupil will succeed in <i>his</i> efforts if <i>he</i> is
ambitious."</p>
<p>Again, if we wish to know about the ownership of a house, we
evidently cannot state the owner's name, but by a question we say,
"<i>Whose</i> house is that?" thus placing a word instead of the
name till we learn the name.</p>
<p>This is not to be understood as implying that pronouns were
<i>invented</i> because nouns were tiresome, since history shows
that pronouns are as old as nouns and verbs. The use of pronouns
must have sprung up naturally, from a necessity for short,
definite, and representative words.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p>A <b>pronoun</b> is a reference word, standing for a name, or
for a person or thing, or for a group of persons or things.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><i>Classes
of pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>73.</b></span> Pronouns may be grouped in
five classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Personal pronouns</b>, which distinguish person by their
form (Sec. 76).</p>
<p>(2) <b>Interrogative pronouns</b>, which are used to ask
questions about persons or things.</p>
<p>(3) <b>Relative pronouns</b>, which relate or refer to a noun,
pronoun, or other word or expression, and at the same time connect
two statements They are also called <b>conjunctive</b>.</p>
<p>(4) <b>Adjective pronouns</b>, words, primarily adjectives,
which are classed as adjectives when they modify nouns, but as
pronouns when they stand for nouns.</p>
<p>(5) <b>Indefinite pronouns</b>, which cannot be used as
adjectives, but stand for an indefinite number of persons or
things.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of all these will be given under the separate
classes hereafter treated.</p>
<h3>PERSONAL PRONOUNS..</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Person in grammar.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>74.</b></span> Since pronouns stand for
persons as well as names, they must represent the person talking,
the person or thing spoken to, and the person or thing talked
about.</p>
<p>This gives rise to a new term, "the distinction of
<i>person</i>."</p>
<div class="sidenote">Person <i>of nouns</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>75.</b></span> This distinction was not
needed in discussing nouns, as nouns have the <i>same form</i>,
whether representing persons and things spoken to or spoken of. It
is evident that a noun could not represent the person speaking,
even if it had a special form.</p>
<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>From analogy to pronouns,
which have <i>forms</i> for person, nouns are sometimes spoken of
as first or second person by their <i>use</i>; that is, if they are
in apposition with a pronoun of the first or second person, they
are said to have person by agreement.</p>
<p>But usually nouns represent something spoken of.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Three persons of pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>76.</b></span> Pronouns naturally are of
three persons:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) First person, representing the person speaking.</p>
<p>(2) Second person, representing a person or thing spoken to.</p>
<p>(3) Third person, standing for a person or thing spoken of.</p>

<h3>Remarks on These Forms.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>First and second persons without
gender.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>78.</b></span> It will be noticed that the
pronouns of the first and second persons have no forms to
distinguish gender. The speaker may be either male or female, or,
by personification, neuter; so also with the person or thing spoken
to.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Third person</i> singular <i>has
gender</i>.</div>
<p>But the third person has, in the singular, a separate form for
each gender, and also for the neuter.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><i>Old
forms</i>.</div>
<p>In Old English these three were formed from the same root;
namely, masculine <i>h&#275;</i>, feminine <i>h&#275;o</i>, neuter
<i>hit</i>.</p>
<p>The form <i>hit</i> (for <i>it</i>) is still heard in vulgar
English, and <i>hoo</i> (for <i>h&#275;o</i>) in some dialects of
England.</p>
<p>The plurals were <i>h&#299;</i>, <i>heora</i>, <i>heom</i>, in
Old English; the forms <i>they</i>, <i>their</i>, <i>them</i>,
perhaps being from the English demonstrative, though influenced by
the cognate Norse forms.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Second person always plural in ordinary
English.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>79.</b></span> <i>Thou</i>, <i>thee</i>,
etc., are old forms which are now out of use in ordinary speech.
The consequence is, that we have no singular pronoun of the second
person in ordinary speech or prose, but make the plural <i>you</i>
do duty for the singular. We use it with a plural verb always, even
when referring to a single object.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Two uses of the old singulars.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>80.</b></span> There are, however, two
modern uses of <i>thou, thy</i>, etc.:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>In elevated style</i>, especially in poetry;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i4">With <i>thy</i> clear keen
joyance<br /></span> <span class="i6">Languor cannot
be;<br /></span> <span class="i4">Shadow of annoyance<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Never came near <i>thee</i>;<br /></span>
<span><i>Thou</i> lovest; but ne'er knew love's sad
satiety.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shelley.</span></div>
</div>
<p>(2) <i>In addressing the Deity</i>, as in prayers, etc.; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Oh, <i>thou</i> Shepherd of Israel, that didst comfort
<i>thy</i> people of old, to <i>thy</i> care we commit the
helpless.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Beecher.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The form</i> its.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>81.</b></span> It is worth while to consider
the possessive <i>its</i>. This is of comparatively recent growth.
The old form was <i>his</i> (from the nominative <i>hit</i>), and
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>this continued in use till the
sixteenth century. The transition from the old <i>his</i> to the
modern <i>its</i> is shown in these sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1 He anointed the altar and all <i>his</i>
vessels.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Bible</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>Here <i>his</i> refers to <i>altar</i>, which is a neuter noun.
The quotation represents the usage of the early sixteenth
century.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>2 It's had <i>it</i> head bit off by <i>it</i> young<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare</span></p>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare uses <i>his</i>, <i>it</i>, and sometimes
<i>its</i>, as possessive of <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>In Milton's poetry (seventeenth century) <i>its</i> occurs only
three times.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>3 See heaven <i>its</i> sparkling portals wide
display<span class="smcap">&mdash;Pope</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A relic of the olden time.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>82.</b></span> We have an interesting relic
in such sentences as this from Thackeray: "One of the ways to know
'<i>em</i> is to watch the scared looks of the ogres' wives and
children."</p>
<p>As shown above, the Old English objective was <i>hem</i> (or
<i>heom</i>), which was often sounded with the <i>h</i> silent,
just as we now say, "I saw '<i>im</i> yesterday" when the word
<i>him</i> is not emphatic. In spoken English, this form '<i>em</i>
has survived side by side with the literary <i>them</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the pronouns in
personification.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>83.</b></span> The pronouns <i>he</i> and
<i>she</i> are often used in poetry, and sometimes in ordinary
speech, to personify objects (Sec. 34).</p>
<h3>CASES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h3>
<h3>I The Nominative.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Nominative forms.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>84.</b></span> The nominative forms of
personal pronouns have the same uses as the nominative of nouns
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>(see Sec. 58). The case of most
of these pronouns can be determined more easily than the case of
nouns, for, besides a nominative <i>use</i>, they have a nominative
form. The words <i>I</i>, <i>thou</i>, <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>,
<i>we</i>, <i>ye</i>, <i>they</i>, are very rarely anything but
nominative in literary English, though <i>ye</i> is occasionally
used as objective.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Additional nominatives in spoken
English.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>85.</b></span> In spoken English, however,
there are some others that are added to the list of nominatives:
they are, <i>me</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>us</i>,
<i>them</i>, when they occur in the <i>predicate position</i>. That
is, in such a sentence as, "I am sure it was <i>him</i>," the
literary language would require <i>he</i> after <i>was</i>; but
colloquial English regularly uses as predicate nominatives the
forms <i>me</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>us</i>, <i>them</i>,
though those named in Sec. 84 are always subjects. Yet careful
speakers avoid this, and follow the usage of literary English.</p>
<h3>II. The Possessive.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Not a separate class.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>86.</b></span> The forms <i>my</i>,
<i>thy</i>, <i>his</i>, <i>her</i>, <i>its</i>, <i>our</i>,
<i>your</i>, <i>their</i>, are sometimes grouped separately as
POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS, but it is better to speak of them as the
possessive case of personal pronouns, just as we speak of the
possessive case of nouns, and not make more classes.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Absolute <i>personal pronouns.</i></div>
<p>The forms <i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>hers</i>,
<i>theirs</i>, sometimes <i>his</i> and <i>its</i>, have a peculiar
use, standing apart from the words they modify instead of
immediately before them. From this use they are called ABSOLUTE
PERSONAL PRONOUNS, or, some say, ABSOLUTE POSSESSIVES.</p>
<p><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>As instances of the use of
absolute pronouns, note the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>'Twas <i>mine</i>, 'tis <i>his</i>, and has been slave to
thousands. <span class="smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p>And since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee
<i>mine</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Cowper.</span></p>
<p>My arm better than <i>theirs</i> can ward it off.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Landor.</span></p>
<p><i>Thine</i> are the city and the people of Granada.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bulwer.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Old use of</i> mine <i>and</i>
thine.</div>
<p>Formerly <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> stood before their nouns,
if the nouns began with a vowel or <i>h</i> silent;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Shall I not take <i>mine</i> ease in <i>mine</i>
inn?<span class="smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p>Give every man <i>thine</i> ear, but few thy
voice.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
<p>If <i>thine</i> eye offend thee, pluck it
out.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Bible.</i></span></p>
<p>My greatest apprehension was for <i>mine</i> eyes.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This usage is still preserved in poetry.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Double and triple possessives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>87.</b></span> The forms <i>hers</i>,
<i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>theirs</i>, are really double
possessives, since they add the possessive <i>s</i> to what is
already a regular possessive inflection.</p>
<p>Besides this, we have, as in nouns, a possessive phrase made up
of the preposition <i>of</i> with these double possessives,
<i>hers</i>, <i>ours</i>, <i>yours</i>, <i>theirs</i>, and with
<i>mine</i>, <i>thine</i>, <i>his</i>, sometimes <i>its</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Their uses.</i></div>
<p>Like the noun possessives, they have several uses:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>To prevent ambiguity</i>, as in the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I have often contrasted the habitual qualities of that gloomy
friend <i>of theirs</i> with the astounding spirits of Thackeray
and Dickens.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. T. Fields</span>.</p>

<p>What would the last two sentences mean if the word <i>my</i>
were written instead of <i>of mine</i>, and preceded the nouns?</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>About the case of absolute
pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>88.</b></span> In their function, or use in
a sentence, the absolute possessive forms of the personal pronouns
are very much like adjectives used as nouns.</p>
<p>In such sentences as, "<i>The good</i> alone are great," "None
but <i>the brave</i> deserves <i>the fair</i>," the words
italicized have an adjective force and also a noun force, as shown
in Sec. 20.</p>
<p>So in the sentences illustrating absolute pronouns in Sec. 86:
<i>mine</i> stands for <i>my property</i>, <i>his</i> for <i>his
property</i>, in the first sentence; <i>mine</i> <a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66"></a>stands for <i>my praise</i> in the second. But the
first two have a nominative use, and <i>mine</i> in the second has
an objective use.</p>
<p>They may be spoken of as possessive in form, but nominative or
objective in use, according as the modified word is in the
nominative or the objective.</p>
<h3>III. The Objective.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The old</i> dative <i>case.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>89.</b></span> In Old English there was one
case which survives in use, but not in form. In such a sentence as
this one from Thackeray, "Pick <i>me</i> out a whip-cord thong with
some dainty knots in it," the word <i>me</i> is evidently not the
direct object of the verb, but expresses <i>for whom</i>, <i>for
whose benefit</i>, the thing is done. In pronouns, this
<b>dative</b> use, as it is called, was marked by a separate
case.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Now the objective.</i></div>
<p>In Modern English the same <i>use</i> is frequently seen, but
the <i>form</i> is the same as the objective. For this reason a
word thus used is called a <b>dative-objective</b>.</p>
<p>The following are examples of the dative-objective:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Give <i>me</i> neither poverty nor riches.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap"><i>Bible.</i></span></p>
<p>Curse <i>me</i> this people.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
<p>Both joined in making <i>him</i> a present.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay</span></p>
<p>Is it not enough that you have <i>burnt me</i> down three houses
with your dog's tricks, and be hanged to you!<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lamb</span></p>
<p>I give <i>thee</i> this to wear at the collar.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Scott</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Other uses of the objective.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>90.</b></span> Besides this use of the
objective, there are others:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>As the direct object of a verb.</i></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>They all handled <i>it</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lamb</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>(2) <i>As the object of a
preposition.</i></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Time is behind <i>them</i> and before <i>them</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(3) <i>In apposition.</i></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>She sate all last summer by the bedside of the blind beggar,
<i>him</i> that so often and so gladly I talked with.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
</div>
<h3>SPECIAL USES OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Indefinite use of</i> you <i>and</i>
your.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>91.</b></span> The word <i>you</i>, and its
possessive case <i>yours</i> are sometimes used without reference
to a particular person spoken to. They approach the indefinite
pronoun in use.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Your</i> mere puny stripling, that winced at the least
flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Irving</span></p>
<p>To empty here, <i>you</i> must condense there.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>The peasants take off their hats as <i>you</i> pass; <i>you</i>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Uses of</i> it.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>92.</b></span> The pronoun <i>it</i> has a
number of uses:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>To refer to some single word preceding</i>;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Ferdinand ordered the <i>army</i> to recommence <i>its</i>
march.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bulwer.</span></p>
<p><i>Society</i>, in this century, has not made <i>its</i>

in trifles.&mdash;<span class="smcap">D. Webster</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>(2) <i>To refer to a preceding word group</i>; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If any man should do wrong merely out of ill nature, why, yet
<i>it</i> is but like the thorn or brier, which prick and scratch
because they can do no other.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bacon.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here <i>it</i> refers back to the whole sentence before it, or
to the idea, "any man's doing wrong merely out of ill nature."</p>
<p><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>(3) <i>As a grammatical
subject, to stand for the real, logical subject, which follows the
verb</i>; as in the sentences,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>It</i> is easy in the world <i>to live after the world's

<p><i>It</i> is a pity <i>that he has so much learning, or that he
has not a great deal more</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Addison.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(4) <i>As an impersonal subject in certain expressions which

<p><i>It</i> was late and after midnight.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(5) <i>As an impersonal or indefinite object of a verb or a

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Michael Paw, who <i>lorded it</i> over the fair
regions of ancient Pavonia.<span class=

an end <i>of it</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Holmes.</span></p>
<p>Poor Christian was hard put <i>to it</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bunyan.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Reflexive use of the personal
pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>93.</b></span> The personal pronouns in the
objective case are often used <i>reflexively</i>; that is,
referring to the same person as the subject of the accompanying
verb. For example, we use such expressions as, "I found <i>me</i> a
good book," "He bought <i>him</i> a horse," <a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69"></a>etc. This reflexive use of the
<i>dative</i>-objective is very common in spoken and in literary
English.</p>
<p>The personal pronouns are not often used reflexively, however,
when they are <i>direct</i> objects. This occurs in poetry, but
seldom in prose; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Now I lay <i>me</i> down to sleep.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Anon.</span></p>
<p>I set <i>me</i> down and sigh.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Burns.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And millions in those solitudes, since
first<br /></span> <span>The flight of years began, have laid
<i>them</i> down<br /></span> <span>In their last
sleep.<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Bryant.</span></div>
</div>
<h3>REFLEXIVE OR COMPOUND PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Composed of the personal pronouns with</i>
-self, -selves.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>94.</b></span> The REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS, or
COMPOUND PERSONAL, as they are also called, are formed from the
personal pronouns by adding the word <i>self</i>, and its plural
<i>selves</i>.</p>
<p>They are <i>myself</i>, (<i>ourself</i>), <i>ourselves</i>,
<i>yourself</i>, (<i>thyself</i>), <i>yourselves</i>,
<i>himself</i>, <i>herself</i>, <i>itself</i>,
<i>themselves</i>.</p>
<p>Of the two forms in parentheses, the second is the old form of
the second person, used in poetry.</p>
<p><i>Ourself</i> is used to follow the word <i>we</i> when this
represents a single person, especially in the speech of rulers;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Methinks he seems no better than a
girl;<br /></span> <span>As girls were once, as we <i>ourself</i>
have been.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Tennyson.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Origin of these reflexives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>95.</b></span> The question might arise, Why
are <i>himself</i> and <i>themselves</i> not <i>hisself</i> and
<i>theirselves</i>, as in vulgar English, after the analogy of
<i>myself</i>, <i>ourselves</i>, etc.?</p>
<p>The history of these words shows they are made up of the
dative-objective forms, not the possessive forms, with <i>self</i>.
In Middle English the forms <a name="Page_70" id=
"Page_70"></a><i>meself</i>, <i>theself</i>, were changed into the
possessive <i>myself</i>, <i>thyself</i>, and the others were
formed by analogy with these. <i>Himself</i> and <i>themselves</i>
are the only ones retaining a distinct objective form.</p>
<p>In the forms <i>yourself</i> and <i>yourselves</i> we have the
possessive <i>your</i> marked as singular as well as plural.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the reflexives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>96.</b></span> There are three uses of
reflexive pronouns:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>As object of a verb or preposition, and referring to the
same person or thing as the subject</i>; as in these sentences from
Emerson:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>He who offers <i>himself</i> a candidate for that covenant comes
up like an Olympian.</p>
<p>I should hate <i>myself</i> if then I made my other friends my
asylum.</p>
<p>We fill <i>ourselves</i> with ancient learning.</p>
<p>What do we know of nature or of <i>ourselves</i>?</p>
</div>
<p>(2) <i>To emphasize a noun or pronoun</i>; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The great globe <i>itself</i> ... shall dissolve.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i8">Threats to all;<br /></span>
<span>To <i>you yourself</i>, to us, to every one.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">&mdash;<i>Id.</i></span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Who would not sing for Lycidas! he
knew<br /></span> <span><i>Himself</i> to sing, and build the lofty
rhyme.<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Milton.</span></div>
</div>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;In such sentences the pronoun is sometimes omitted,
and the reflexive modifies the pronoun understood; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Only <i>itself</i> can inspire whom it will.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>My hands are full of blossoms plucked before, Held dead within
them till <i>myself</i> shall die.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. B.
Browning</span>.</p>
<p>As if it were <i>thyself</i> that's here, I shrink with
pain.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>(3) <i>As the precise
equivalent of a personal pronoun</i>; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Lord Altamont designed to take his son and
<i>myself</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p>Victories that neither <i>myself</i> nor my cause always

<h3>INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Three now in use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>97.</b></span> The interrogative pronouns
now in use are <i>who</i> (with the forms <i>whose</i> and
<i>whom</i>), <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>One obsolete.</i></div>
<p>There is an old word, <i>whether</i>, used formerly to mean
which of two, but now obsolete. Examples from the Bible:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Whether</i> of them twain did the will of his father?</p>
<p><i>Whether</i> is greater, the gold, or the temple?</p>
</div>
<p>From Steele (eighteenth century):&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It may be a question <i>whether</i> of these unfortunate persons
had the greater soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of</i> who <i>and its forms.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>98.</b></span> The use of <i>who</i>, with
its possessive and objective, is seen in these
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Who</i> is she in bloody coronation robes from
Rheims?<span class="smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span><i>Whose</i> was that gentle voice, that,
whispering sweet,<br /></span> <span>Promised, methought, long days
of bliss sincere?<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bowles.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>What doth she look on? <i>Whom</i> doth she behold?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></p>
</div>
<p>From these sentences it will be seen that interrogative
<i>who</i> refers to <i>persons only</i>; that it is not inflected
for gender or number, but for case alone, having three forms; it is
always third person, as it always asks <i>about</i> somebody.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of</i> which.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>99.</b></span> Examples of the use of
interrogative <i>which</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Which</i> of these had speed enough to sweep between the
question and the answer, and divide the one from the
other?<span class="smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p><i>Which</i> of you, shall we say, doth love us
most?<span class="smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p><i>Which</i> of them [the sisters] shall I
take?&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>As shown here, <i>which</i>
is not inflected for gender, number, or case; it refers to either
persons or things; it is selective, that is, picks out one or more
from a number of known persons or objects.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of</i> what.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>100.</b></span> Sentences showing the use of
interrogative <i>what</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Since I from Smaylho'me tower have
been,<br /></span> <span><i>What</i> did thy lady do?<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>What</i> is so rare as a day in June?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
<p><i>What</i> wouldst thou do, old man?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
</div>
<p>These show that <i>what</i> is not inflected for case; that it
is always singular and neuter, referring to things, ideas, actions,
etc., not to persons.</p>
<h3>DECLENSION OF INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>101.</b></span> The following are all the
interrogative forms:&mdash;</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td align='left'>SING. AND PLUR.</td>
<td align='left'>SING. AND PLUR.</td>
<td align='left'>SINGULAR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align='left'><i>Nom.</i></td>
<td align='left'>who?</td>
<td align='left'>which?</td>
<td align='left'>what?</td>

<td align='left'><i>Poss.</i></td>
<td align='left'>whose?</td>
<td align='left'>&mdash;</td>

<tr>
<td align='left'><i>Obj.</i></td>
<td align='left'>whom?</td>
<td align='left'>which?</td>
<td align='left'>what?</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In spoken English, <i>who</i> is used as objective instead of
<i>whom</i>; as, "<i>Who</i> did you see?" "<i>Who</i> did he speak
to?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>To tell the case of
interrogatives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>102.</b></span> The interrogative <i>who</i>
has a separate form for each case, consequently the case can be
told by the form of the word; but the case of <i>which</i> and
<i>what</i> must be determined exactly as in nouns,&mdash;by the
<i>use</i> of the words.</p>
<p>For instance, in Sec. 99, <i>which</i> is nominative in the
first sentence, since it is subject of the verb <i>had</i>;
nominative in the second also, subject of <a name="Page_74" id=
"Page_74"></a><i>doth love</i>; objective in the last, being the
direct object of the verb <i>shall take</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Further treatment of</i> who, which
<i>and</i> what.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>103.</b></span> <i>Who</i>, <i>which</i>,
and <i>what</i> are also relative pronouns; <i>which</i> and
<i>what</i> are sometimes adjectives; <i>what</i> may be an adverb
in some expressions.</p>
<p>They will be spoken of again in the proper places, especially in
the treatment of indirect questions (Sec. 127).</p>
<h3>RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Function of the relative
pronoun</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>104.</b></span> <b>Relative pronouns</b>
differ from both personal and interrogative pronouns in referring
to an antecedent, and also in having a conjunctive use. The
advantage in using them is to unite short statements into longer
sentences, and so to make smoother discourse. Thus we may say, "The
last of all the Bards was he. These bards sang of Border chivalry."
Or, it may be shortened into,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"The last of all the Bards was
he,<br /></span> <span><i>Who</i> sung of Border
chivalry."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>In the latter sentence, <i>who</i> evidently refers to
<i>Bards</i>, which is called the <b>antecedent</b> of the
relative.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The antecedent.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>105.</b></span> The <b>antecedent</b> of a
pronoun is the noun, pronoun, or other word or expression, for
which the pronoun stands. It usually precedes the pronoun.</p>
<p>Personal pronouns of the third person may have antecedents also,
as they take the place usually of a word already used;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The priest hath <i>his</i> fee who comes and shrives
us.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Lowell</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this, both <i>his</i> and <i>who</i> have the antecedent
<i>priest</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>The pronoun <i>which</i> may
have its antecedent following, and the antecedent may be a word or
a group of words, as will be shown in the remarks on <i>which</i>
below.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Two kinds.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>106.</b></span> Relatives may be SIMPLE or
INDEFINITE.</p>
<p>When the word <i>relative</i> is used, a simple relative is
meant. Indefinite relatives, and the indefinite use of simple
relatives, will be discussed further on.</p>
<p>The SIMPLE RELATIVES are <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>what</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Who <i>and its forms.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>107.</b></span> Examples of the relative

<h3>REMARKS ON THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><b>Who.</b></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>111.</b></span> By reading carefully the
sentences in Sec. 107, the following facts will be noticed about
the relative <i>who</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) It usually refers to persons: thus, in the first sentence,
Sec. 107, <i>a man...who</i>; in the second, <i>that
man...whose</i>; in the third, <i>son</i>, <i>whom</i>; and so
on.</p>
<p>(2) It has three case forms,&mdash;<i>who</i>, <i>whose</i>,
<i>whom</i>.</p>
<p>(3) The forms do not change for person or number of the
antecedent. In sentence 4, <i>who</i> is first person; in 5,
<i>whose</i> is second person; the others are all third person. In
1, 2, and 3, the relatives are singular; in 4, 5, and 6, they are
plural.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Who <i>referring to animals</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>112.</b></span> Though in most cases
<i>who</i> refers to persons there are instances found where it
refers to animals. It has been seen (Sec. 24) that animals are
referred to by personal pronouns when their characteristics or
habits are such as to render them important or interesting to man.
Probably on the same principle the personal relative <i>who</i> is
used not infrequently in literature, referring to animals.</p>
<p>Witness the following examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>And you, warm little housekeeper [the cricket], <i>who</i> class
With those who think the candles come too soon.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Leigh Hunt.</span></p>
<p>The robins...have succeeded in driving off the bluejays
<i>who</i> used to build in our pines.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
<p>The little gorilla, <i>whose</i> wound I had dressed, flung its
arms around my neck.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>A lake frequented by every fowl <i>whom</i> Nature has taught to
dip the wing in water.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dr.
Johnson.</span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></p>
<p>While we had such plenty of domestic insects <i>who</i>
infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to
weave as well as to spin.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
<p>My horse, <i>who</i>, under his former rider had hunted the
buffalo, seemed as much excited as myself.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Irving.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Other examples might be quoted from Burke, Kingsley, Smollett,
Scott, Cooper, Gibbon, and others.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Which.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>113.</b></span> The sentences in Sec. 108
show that&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Which</i> refers to animals, things, or ideas, not
persons.</p>
<p>(2) It is not inflected for gender or number.</p>
<p>(3) It is nearly always third person, rarely second (an example
of its use as second person is given in sentence 32, p. 96).</p>
<p>(4) It has two case forms,&mdash;<i>which</i> for the nominative
and objective, <i>whose</i> for the possessive.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Examples of</i> whose, <i>possessive case
of</i> which.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>114.</b></span> Grammarians sometimes object
to the statement that <i>whose</i> is the possessive of
<i>which</i>, saying that the phrase <i>of which</i> should always
be used instead; yet a search in literature shows that the
possessive form <i>whose</i> is quite common in prose as well as in
poetry: for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I swept the horizon, and saw at one glance the glorious
elevations, on <i>whose</i> tops the sun kindled all the melodies
and harmonies of light.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap">Beecher.</span></p>
<p>Men may be ready to fight to the death, and to persecute without
pity, for a religion <i>whose</i> creed they do not understand, and
<i>whose</i> precepts they habitually disobey.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap">Macaulay</span></p>
<p>Beneath these sluggish waves lay the once proud cities of the
plain, <i>whose</i> grave was dug by the thunder of the
heavens.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span><a name="Page_79"
id="Page_79"></a></p>
<p>Many great and opulent cities <i>whose</i> population now
exceeds that of Virginia during the Revolution, and <i>whose</i>
names are spoken in the remotest corner of the civilized
world.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Mcmaster.</span></p>
<p>Through the heavy door <i>whose</i> bronze network closes the
place of his rest, let us enter the church itself.<span class=

its terminus.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
</div>
<p>So in Matthew Arnold, Kingsley, Burke, and numerous others.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Which <i>and its antecedents</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>115.</b></span> The last two sentences in
Sec. 108 show that <i>which</i> may have other antecedents than
nouns and pronouns. In 5 (<i>a</i>) there is a participial
adjective used as the antecedent; in 5 (<i>b</i>) there is a
complete clause employed as antecedent. This often occurs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, too, the antecedent follows <i>which</i>;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And, which is worse, <i>all you have
done</i><br /></span> <span><i>Hath been but for a wayward

<div class="blockquot">

<i>men of business rarely know the meaning of the word

<p>I demurred to this honorary title upon two grounds,&mdash;first,
as being one toward which I had no natural aptitudes or
predisposing advantages; secondly (which made her stare), <i>as

</div>
<div class="sidenote">That.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>116.</b></span> In the sentences of Sec.
109, we notice that&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>That</i> refers to persons, animals, and things.</p>
<p>(2) It has only one case form, no possessive.</p>
<p>(3) It is the same form for first, second, and third
persons.</p>
<p>(4) It has the same form for singular and plural.</p>
<p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>It sometimes borrows the
possessive <i>whose</i>, as in sentence 6, Sec. 109, but this is
not sanctioned as good usage.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>117.</b></span> The sentences of Sec. 110
show that&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>What</i> always refers to things; is always neuter.</p>
<p>(2) It is used almost entirely in the singular.</p>
<p>(3) Its antecedent is hardly ever expressed. When expressed, it
usually follows, and is emphatic; as, for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>What I would, <i>that</i> do I not; but what I hate, <i>that</i>
do I.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Bible</i></span></p>
<p>What fates impose, <i>that</i> men must needs abide.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
<p>What a man does, <i>that</i> he has.<span class=

<h3>DECLENSION OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>118.</b></span> These are the forms of the
simple relatives:&mdash;</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>

</table>
<h3>HOW TO PARSE RELATIVES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>119.</b></span> The <i>gender</i>,
<i>number</i>, and <i>person</i> of the relatives <i>who</i>,
<i>which</i>, and <i>that</i> must be determined by those of the
antecedent; the <i>case</i> depends upon the function of the
relative in its own clause.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following sentence:<a name="Page_81"
id="Page_81"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"He uttered truths <i>that</i> wrought upon and molded the lives
of those <i>who</i> heard him."</p>
</div>
<p>Since the relatives hold the sentence together, we can, by
taking them out, let the sentence fall apart into three divisions:
(1) "He uttered truths;" (2) "The truths wrought upon and molded
the lives of the people;" (3) "These people heard him."</p>
<p><i>That</i> evidently refers to <i>truths</i>, consequently is
neuter, third person, plural number. <i>Who</i> plainly stands for
<i>those</i> or <i>the people</i>, either of which would be neuter,
third person, plural number. Here the relative agrees with its
antecedent.</p>
<p>We cannot say the relative agrees with its antecedent in
<i>case</i>. <i>Truths</i> in sentence (2), above, is subject of
<i>wrought upon and molded</i>; in (1), it is object of
<i>uttered</i>. In (2), <i>people</i> is the object of the
preposition <i>of</i>; in (3), it is subject of the verb
<i>heard</i>. Now, <i>that</i> takes the case of <i>the truths</i>
in (2), not of <i>truths</i> which is expressed in the sentence:
consequently <i>that</i> is in the nominative case. In the same way
<i>who</i>, standing for <i>the people</i> understood, subject of
<i>heard</i>, is in the nominative case.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>First find the antecedents, then parse the relatives, in the
following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. How superior it is in these respects to the pear, whose
blossoms are neither colored nor fragrant!</p>
<p>2. Some gnarly apple which I pick up in the road reminds me by
its fragrance of all the wealth of Pomona.</p>
<p>3. Perhaps I talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels
for filling an order.</p>
<p><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>4. Ill blows the wind that
profits nobody.</p>
<p>5. Alas! it is we ourselves that are getting buried alive under
this avalanche of earthly impertinences.</p>
<p>6. This method also forces upon us the necessity of thinking,
which is, after all, the highest result of all education.</p>
<p>7. I know that there are many excellent people who object to the
reading of novels as a waste of time.</p>
<p>8. I think they are trying to outwit nature, who is sure to be
cunninger than they.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Parsing</i> what, <i>the simple
relative</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>120.</b></span> The relative <i>what</i> is
handled differently, because it has usually no antecedent, but is
singular, neuter, third person. Its case is determined exactly as
that of other relatives. In the sentence, "What can't be cured must
be endured," the verb <i>must be endured</i> is the predicate of
something. What must be endured? Answer, <i>What can't be
cured</i>. The whole expression is its subject. The word
<i>what</i>, however, is subject of the verb <i>can't be cured</i>,
and hence is in the nominative case.</p>
<p>"What we call nature is a certain self-regulated motion or
change." Here the subject of <i>is</i>, etc., is <i>what we call
nature</i>; but of this, <i>we</i> is the subject, and <i>what</i>
is the direct object of the verb <i>call</i>, so is in the
objective case.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Another way.</i></div>
<p>Some prefer another method of treatment. As shown by the
following sentences, <i>what</i> is equivalent to <i>that
which</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It has been said that "common souls pay with <i>what</i> they
do, nobler souls with <i>that which</i> they are."<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p><i>That which</i> is pleasant often appears under the name of
evil; and <i>what</i> is disagreeable to nature is called good and
virtuous.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Burke.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Hence some take <i>what</i> as a double relative, and parse
<i>that</i> in the first clause, and <i>which</i> in the
sec<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>ond clause; that is, "common
souls pay with <i>that</i> [singular, object of <i>with</i>]
<i>which</i> [singular, object of <i>do</i>] they do."</p>
<h3>INDEFINITE RELATIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>List and examples.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>121.</b></span> INDEFINITE RELATIVES are, by
meaning and use, not as direct as the simple relatives.</p>
<p>They are <i>whoever</i>, <i>whichever</i>, <i>whatever</i>,
<i>whatsoever</i>; less common are <i>whoso</i>, <i>whosoever</i>,
<i>whichsoever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>. The simple relatives
<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, and <i>what</i> may also be used as
indefinite relatives. Examples of indefinite relatives (from
Emerson):&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. <i>Whoever</i> has flattered his friend successfully must at
once think himself a knave, and his friend a fool.</p>
<p>2. It is no proof of a man's understanding, to be able to affirm
<i>whatever</i> he pleases.</p>
<p>3. They sit in a chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or
stand on their head, or <i>what</i> else <i>soever</i>, in a new
and original way.</p>
<p>4. <i>Whoso</i> is heroic will always find crises to try his
edge.</p>
<p>5. Only itself can inspire <i>whom</i> it will.</p>
<p>6. God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose.
Take <i>which</i> you please,&mdash;you cannot have both.</p>
<p>7. Do <i>what</i> we can, summer will have its flies.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Meaning and use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>122.</b></span> The fitness of the term
<i>indefinite</i> here cannot be shown better than by examining the
following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. There is something so overruling in <i>whatever</i> inspires
us with awe, in <i>all things which</i> belong ever so remotely to
terror, that nothing else can stand in their presence.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Burke.</span></p>
<p>2. Death is there associated, not with <i>everything that</i> is
most endearing in social and domestic charities, but with
<i>whatever</i> is darkest in human nature and in human
destiny.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>It is clear that in 1,
<i>whatever</i> is equivalent to <i>all things which</i>, and in 2,
to <i>everything that</i>; no certain antecedent, no particular
thing, being referred to. So with the other indefinites.</p>
<div class="sidenote">What <i>simple relative and</i> what
<i>indefinite relative</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>123.</b></span> The above helps us to
discriminate between <i>what</i> as a simple and <i>what</i> as an
indefinite relative.</p>
<p>As shown in Sec. 120, the simple relative <i>what</i> is
equivalent to <i>that which</i> or the <i>thing
which</i>,&mdash;some particular thing; as shown by the last
sentence in Sec. 121, <i>what</i> means <i>anything that</i>,
<i>everything that</i> (or <i>everything which</i>). The difference
must be seen by the meaning of the sentence, as <i>what</i> hardly
ever has an antecedent.</p>
<p>The examples in sentences 5 and 6, Sec. 121, show that
<i>who</i> and <i>which</i> have no antecedent expressed, but mean
<i>any one whom</i>, <i>either one that</i>, etc.</p>
<h3>OTHER WORDS USED AS RELATIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote">But <i>and</i> as.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>124.</b></span> Two words, <b>but</b> and
<b>as</b>, are used with the force of relative pronouns in some
expressions; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. There is not a leaf rotting on the highway <i>but</i> has
force in it: how else could it rot?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
<p>2. This, amongst such other troubles <i>as</i> most men meet
with in this life, has been my heaviest affliction.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Proof that they have the force of
relatives.</i></div>
<p>Compare with these the two following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>3. There is nothing <i>but</i> is related to us, nothing
<i>that</i> does <i>not</i> interest us.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>4. There were articles of comfort and luxury such <i>as</i>
Hester never ceased to use, but <i>which</i> only wealth could have
purchased.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>Sentence 3 shows that
<i>but</i> is equivalent to the relative <i>that</i> with
<i>not</i>, and that <i>as</i> after <i>such</i> is equivalent to
<i>which</i>.</p>
<p>For <i>as</i> after <i>same</i> see "Syntax" (Sec. 417).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Former use of</i> as.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>125.</b></span> In early modern English,
<i>as</i> was used just as we use <i>that</i> or <i>which</i>, not
following the word <i>such</i>; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>I have not from your eyes that
gentleness<br /></span> <span>And show of love <i>as</i> I was wont
to have.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare</span></div>
</div>
<p>This still survives in vulgar English in England; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Don't you mind Lucy Passmore, <i>as</i> charmed your warts for
you when you was a boy? "<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley</span></p>
</div>
<p>This is frequently illustrated in Dickens's works.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Other substitutes.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>126.</b></span> Instead of the phrases <i>in
which</i>, <i>upon which</i>, <i>by which</i>, etc., the
conjunctions <i>wherein</i>, <i>whereupon</i>, <i>whereby</i>,
etc., are used.</p>

</div>
<h3>PRONOUNS IN INDIRECT QUESTIONS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Special caution needed here.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>127.</b></span> It is sometimes hard for the
student to tell a relative from an interrogative pronoun. In the
regular direct question the interrogative is easily recognized; so
is the relative when an antecedent is close by. But compare the
following in pairs:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) Like a gentleman of leisure <i>who</i> is strolling
out for pleasure.<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Well we knew <i>who</i> stood behind, though the
earthwork hid them.</p>
</div>
<p>2.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) But <i>what</i> you gain in time is perhaps lost in
power.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) But <i>what</i> had become of them they knew not.</p>
</div>
<p>3.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>a</i>) These are the lines <i>which</i> heaven-commanded
Toil shows on his deed.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) And since that time I thought it not amiss To judge
<i>which</i> were the best of all these three.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In sentences 1 (<i>a</i>), 2 (<i>a</i>) and 3 (<i>a</i>) the
regular relative use is seen; <i>who</i> having the antecedent
<i>gentleman</i>, <i>what</i> having the double use of pronoun and
antecedent, <i>which</i> having the antecedent <i>lines</i>.</p>
<p>But in 1 (<i>b</i>), 2 (<i>b</i>), and 3 (<i>b</i>), there are
two points of difference from the others considered: first, no
antecedent is expressed, which would indicate that they are not
relatives; second, a question is disguised in each sentence,
although each sentence as a whole is declarative in form. Thus, 1
(<i>b</i>), if expanded, would be, "Who stood behind? We knew,"
etc., showing that <i>who</i> is plainly interrogative. So in 2
(<i>b</i>), <i>what</i> is interrogative, the full expression
being, "But what had become of them? They knew not." Likewise with
<i>which</i> in 3 (<i>b</i>).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>How to decide.</i></div>
<p>In studying such sentences, (1) see whether there is an
antecedent of <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>, and whether <i>what</i> =
<i>that</i> + <i>which</i> (if so, it is a simple relative; if not,
it is either an indefinite relative or an interrogative pronoun);
(2) see if the pronoun introduces an indirect question (if it does,
it is an interrogative; if not, it is an indefinite relative).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Another caution.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>128.</b></span> On the other hand, care must
be taken to see whether the pronoun is the word that really
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><i>asks the question</i> in an
interrogative sentence. Examine the following:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Sweet rose! whence is this
hue<br /></span> <span><i>Which</i> doth all hues
excel?<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Drummond</span></div>
</div>
<p>2.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And then what wonders shall you
do<br /></span> <span><i>Whose</i> dawning beauty warms us
so?<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Walker</span></div>
</div>
<p>3.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Is this a romance? Or is it a faithful picture of <i>what</i>
has lately been in a neighboring land?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>These are interrogative sentences, but in none of them does the
pronoun ask the question. In the first, <i>whence</i> is the
interrogative word, <i>which</i> has the antecedent <i>hue</i>. In
the second, <i>whose</i> has the antecedent <i>you</i>, and asks no
question. In the third, the question is asked by the verb.</p>
<h3>OMISSION OF THE RELATIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Relative omitted when</i> object.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>129.</b></span> The relative is frequently
omitted in spoken and in literary English when it would be the
object of a preposition or a verb. Hardly a writer can be found who
does not leave out relatives in this way when they can be readily
supplied in the mind of the reader. Thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>These are the sounds we feed upon.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Fletcher.</span></p>
<p>I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader
with all the curiosities I observed.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
</div>
<p><b>Exercise</b>.</p>
<p>Put in the relatives <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, or <i>that</i>
where they are omitted from the following sentences, and see
whether the sentences are any smoother or clearer:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The insect I am now describing lived three years,<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>
<p><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>2. They will go to Sunday
schools through storms their brothers are afraid of.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Holmes.</span></p>
<p>3. He opened the volume he first took from the
shelf.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Eliot</span>.</p>
<p>4. He could give the coals in that queer coal scuttle we read of
to his poor neighbor.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>5. When Goldsmith died, half the unpaid bill he owed to Mr.
William Filby was for clothes supplied to his nephew.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Forster</span></p>
<p>6. The thing I want to see is not Redbook Lists, and Court
Calendars, but the life of man in England.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
<p>7. The material they had to work upon was already democratical
by instinct and habitude.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Relative omitted when</i> subject.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>130.</b></span> We often hear in spoken
English expressions like these:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>There isn't one here &#8248; knows how to play ball.</p>
<p>There was such a crowd &#8248; went, the house was full.</p>
</div>
<p>Here the omitted relative would be in the nominative case. Also
in literary English we find the same omission. It is rare in prose,
and comparatively so in poetry. Examples are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The silent truth that it was she was superior.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I have a mind presages me such thrift.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
</div>

bower,<br /></span> <span class="i2">Ne'er looks upon the
sun.<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">

<h3>ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Function of adjective pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>131.</b></span> Most of the words how to be
considered are capable of a double use,&mdash;they may be pure
modifiers of nouns, or they may stand for nouns. In the first use
they are adjectives; in the second they retain an adjective
<i>meaning</i>, but have lost their adjective <i>use</i>. Primarily
they are adjectives, but in this function, or use, they are
properly classed as adjective pronouns.</p>
<p>The following are some examples of these:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Some</i> say that the place was bewitched.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Irving.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">That mysterious realm where
<i>each</i> shall take<br /></span> <span>His chamber in the silent
halls of death.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bryant.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>How happy is he born or
taught<br /></span> <span class="i2">That serveth not
<i>another's</i> will.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Wotton</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>That</i> is more than any martyr can stand.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution.</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Adjectives, not pronouns.</i></div>
<p>Hence these words are like adjectives used as nouns, which we
have seen in such expressions as, "<i>The dead</i> are there;" that
is, a word, in order to be an adjective pronoun, <i>must not modify
any <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>word, expressed or
understood</i>. It must come under the requirement of pronouns, and
<i>stand for a noun</i>. For instance, in the following
sentences&mdash;"The cubes are of stainless ivory, and on
<i>each</i> is written, in letters of gold, '<i>Truth</i>;'" "You
needs must play such pranks as <i>these</i>;" "They will always
have one bank to sun themselves upon, and <i>another</i> to get
cool under;" "Where two men ride on a horse, <i>one</i> must ride
behind"&mdash;the words italicized modify nouns understood,
necessarily thought of: thus, in the first, "each <i>cube</i>;" in
the second, "these <i>pranks</i>," in the others, "another
<i>bank</i>," "one <i>man</i>."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Classes of adjective pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>132.</b></span> Adjective pronouns are
divided into three classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS, such as <i>this</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>the former</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(2) DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS, such as <i>each</i>, <i>either</i>,
<i>neither</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(3) NUMERAL PRONOUNS, as <i>some</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>few</i>,
<i>many</i>, <i>none</i>, <i>all</i>, etc.</p>
<h3>DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition and examples.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>133.</b></span> A DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUN is
one that definitely points out what persons or things are alluded
to in the sentence.</p>
<p>The person or thing alluded to by the demonstrative may be in
another sentence, or may be the whole of a sentence. For example,
"Be <i>that</i> as it may" could refer to a sentiment in a
sentence, or an argument in a paragraph; but the demonstrative
clearly points to that thing.</p>
<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>The following are examples of
demonstratives:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I did not say <i>this</i> in so many words.</p>
<p>All <i>these</i> he saw; but what he fain had seen He could not
see.</p>
<p>Beyond <i>that</i> I seek not to penetrate the veil.</p>
<p>How much we forgive in <i>those</i> who yield us the rare
spectacle of heroic manners!</p>
<p>The correspondence of Bonaparte with his brother Joseph, when
<i>the latter</i> was the King of Spain.</p>
<p><i>Such</i> are a few isolated instances, accidentally
preserved.</p>
<p>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
wickedness, reap <i>the same</i>.</p>
<p>They know that patriotism has its glorious opportunities and its
sacred duties. They have not shunned <i>the one</i>, and they have
well performed <i>the other</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;It will be noticed in the first four sentences that
<i>this</i> and <i>that</i> are inflected for number.</p>
<h4>Exercises.</h4>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Find six sentences using demonstrative adjective
pronouns.</p>

<p>Their minds accorded into one strain, and made delightful music
which <i>neither</i> could have claimed as all his own.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Compound</i>.</div>

<h2><a name="ADJECTIVES" id=
"ADJECTIVES"></a><b>ADJECTIVES.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Office of Adjectives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>139.</b></span> Nouns are seldom used as
names of objects without additional words joined to them to add to
their meaning. For example, if we wish to speak of a friend's
house, we cannot guide one to it by merely calling it <i>a
house</i>. We need to add some words to tell its color, size,
position, etc., if we are at a distance; and if we are near, we
need some word to point out the house we speak of, so that no other
will be mistaken for it. So with any object, or with persons.</p>
<p>As to the kind of words used, we may begin <a name="Page_98" id=
"Page_98"></a>with the common adjectives telling the
<i>characteristics</i> of an object. If a chemist discovers a new
substance, he cannot describe it to others without telling its
qualities: he will say it is <i>solid</i>, or <i>liquid</i>, or
<i>gaseous</i>; <i>heavy</i> or <i>light</i>; <i>brittle</i> or
<i>tough</i>; <i>white</i> or <i>red</i>; etc.</p>
<p>Again, in <i>pointing out</i> an object, adjectives are used;
such as in the expressions "<i>this</i> man," "<i>that</i> house,"
"<i>yonder</i> hill," etc.</p>
<p>Instead of using nouns indefinitely, the <i>number</i> is
limited by adjectives; as, "<i>one</i> hat," "<i>some</i> cities,"
"<i>a hundred</i> men."</p>
<p>The office of an adjective, then, is to narrow down or limit the
application of a noun. It may have this office alone, or it may at
the same time add to the meaning of the noun.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Substantives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>140.</b></span> Nouns are not, however, the
only words limited by adjectives: pronouns and other words and
expressions also have adjectives joined to them. Any word or word
group that performs the same office as a noun may be modified by
adjectives.</p>
<p>To make this clear, notice the following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Pronoun.</i></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If <i>he</i> be <i>thankful</i> for small benefits, it shows
that he weighs men's minds, and their trash.<span class=

<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>141.</b></span> An <b>adjective</b> is a
word joined to a noun or other substantive word or expression, to
describe it or to limit its application.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><i>Classes
of adjectives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>142.</b></span> Adjectives are divided into
four classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Descriptive adjectives</b>, which describe by expressing
qualities or attributes of a substantive.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Adjectives of quantity</b>, used to tell how many things
are spoken of, or how much of a thing.</p>
<p>(3) <b>Demonstrative adjectives</b>, pointing out particular
things.</p>
<p>(4) <b>Pronominal adjectives</b>, words primarily pronouns, but
used adjectively sometimes in modifying nouns instead of standing
for them. They include relative and interrogative words.</p>
<h3>DESCRIPTIVE ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>143.</b></span> This large class includes
several kinds of words:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) SIMPLE ADJECTIVES expressing quality; such as <i>safe</i>,
<i>happy</i>, <i>deep</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>rash</i>,
<i>beautiful</i>, <i>remotest</i>, <i>terrible</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(2) COMPOUND ADJECTIVES, made up of various words thrown
together to make descriptive epithets. Examples are,
"<i>Heaven-derived</i> power," "this <i>life-giving</i> book," "his
spirit wrapt and <i>wonder-struck</i>," "<i>ice-cold</i> water,"
"<i>half-dead</i> traveler," "<i>unlooked-for</i> burden,"
"<i>next-door</i> neighbor," "<i>ivory-handled</i> pistols," "the
<i>cold-shudder-inspiring</i> Woman in White."</p>
<p>(3) PROPER ADJECTIVES, derived from proper nouns; such as, "an
old <i>English</i> manuscript," "the <i>Christian</i> pearl of
charity," "the well-curb had a <i>Chinese</i> roof," "the
<i>Roman</i> writer Palladius."</p>
<p><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>(4) PARTICIPIAL ADJECTIVES,
which are either pure participles used to describe, or participles
which have lost all verbal force and have no function except to
express quality. Examples are,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Pure participial adjectives</i>: "The <i>healing</i> power of
the Messiah," "The <i>shattering</i> sway of one strong arm,"
"<i>trailing</i> clouds," "The <i>shattered</i> squares have opened
into line," "It came on like the <i>rolling</i> simoom," "God
tempers the wind to the <i>shorn</i> lamb."</p>
<p><i>Faded participial adjectives</i>: "Sleep is a <i>blessed</i>
thing;" "One is hungry, and another is <i>drunken</i>;" "under the
<i>fitting</i> drapery of the jagged and trailing clouds;" "The
clearness and quickness are <i>amazing</i>;" "an <i>aged</i> man;"
"a <i>charming</i> sight."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>144.</b></span> Care is needed, in studying
these last-named words, to distinguish between a participle that
forms part of a verb, and a participle or participial adjective
that belongs to a noun.</p>
<p>For instance: in the sentence, "The work was well and rapidly
accomplished," <i>was accomplished</i> is a verb; in this, "No man
of his day was more brilliant or more accomplished," <i>was</i> is
the verb, and <i>accomplished</i> is an adjective.</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVES OF QUANTITY.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>145.</b></span> Adjectives of quantity tell
<i>how much</i> or <i>how many</i>. They have these three
subdivisions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>How much.</i></div>
<p>(1) QUANTITY IN BULK: such words as <i>little</i>, <i>much</i>,
<i>some</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>considerable</i>, sometimes
<i>small</i>, joined usually to singular nouns to express an
indefinite measure of the thing spoken of.</p>
<p>The following examples are from Kingsley:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>So he parted with <i>much</i> weeping of
the lady.<br /></span> <span>Which we began to do with <i>great</i>
labor and <i>little</i> profit.<br /></span> <span>Because I had
<i>some</i> knowledge of surgery and blood-letting.<br /></span>
<span>But ever she looked on Mr. Oxenham, and seemed to take
<i>no</i><br /></span> <span class="i4">care as long as he was
by.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>Examples of <i>small</i> an adjective of quantity:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The deil's in it but I bude to anger him!" said the woman, and
walked away with a laugh of <i>small</i> satisfaction.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macdonald.</span></p>
<p>'Tis midnight, but <i>small</i> thoughts have I of
sleep.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Coleridge.</span></p>
<p>It gives <i>small</i> idea of Coleridge's way of
talking.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When <i>some</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>no</i>, are used with plural
nouns, they come under the next division of adjectives.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>How many.</i></div>
<p>(2) QUANTITY IN NUMBER, which may be expressed exactly by
numbers or remotely designated by words expressing indefinite
amounts. Hence the natural division into&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Definite numerals</i>; as, "<i>one</i> blaze of
musketry;" "He found in the pathway <i>fourteen</i> Spaniards;" "I
have lost <i>one</i> brother, but I have gained <i>fourscore</i>;"
"<i>a dozen</i> volunteers."</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Indefinite numerals</i>, as the following from
Kingsley: "We gave <i>several</i> thousand pounds for it;" "In came
some five and twenty more, and <a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102"></a>with them <i>a few</i> negroes;" "Then we wandered
for <i>many</i> days;" "Amyas had evidently <i>more</i> schemes in
his head;" "He had lived by hunting for <i>some</i> months;" "That
light is far too red to be the reflection of <i>any</i> beams of
hers."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Single ones of any number of
changes.</i></div>
<p>(3) DISTRIBUTIVE NUMERALS, which occupy a place midway between
the last two subdivisions of numeral adjectives; for they are
indefinite in telling how many objects are spoken of, but definite
in referring to the objects one at a time. Thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Every</i> town had its fair; <i>every</i> village, its
wake.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>An arrow was quivering in <i>each</i> body.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>Few on <i>either</i> side but had their shrewd scratch to
show.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Before I taught my tongue to

<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Bring up sentences with ten adjectives of
quantity.</p>
<h3>DEMONSTRATIVE ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Not primarily pronouns.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>146.</b></span> The words of this list are
placed here instead of among pronominal adjectives, for the reason
that they are felt to be primarily adjectives; their pronominal use
being evidently a shortening, by which the words point out but
stand for words omitted, instead of modifying them. Their natural
and original use is to be joined to a noun following or in close
connection.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The list.</i></div>
<p>The <b>demonstrative adjectives</b> are <i>this</i>,
<i>that</i>, (plural <i>these</i>, <i>those</i>), <i>yonder</i> (or
<i>yon</i>), <i>former</i>, <i>latter</i>; <a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103"></a>also the pairs <i>one</i> (or <i>the
one</i>)&mdash;<i>the other</i>, <i>the former</i>&mdash;<i>the
latter</i>, used to refer to two things which have been already
named in a sentence.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Examples.</i></div>
<p>The following sentences present some examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love, The matron's glance
that would <i>those</i> looks reprove.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>
<p>These were thy charms...but all <i>these</i> charms are
fled.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Yon</i> cloud with <i>that</i> long purple cleft.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></p>

</div>
<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Find sentences with five demonstrative
adjectives.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Ordinal numerals classed under
demonstratives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>147.</b></span> The class of numerals known
as <b>ordinals</b> must be placed here, as having the same function
as demonstrative adjectives. They point out which thing is meant
among a series of things mentioned. The following are
examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>first</i> regular provincial newspapers appear to have
been created in the last decade of the <i>seventeenth</i> century,
and by the middle of the <i>eighteenth</i> century almost every
important provincial town had its local organ.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bancroft.</span></p>
</div>
<p>These do not, like the other numerals, tell <i>how many</i>
things are meant. When we speak of the seventeenth century, we
imply nothing as to how many centuries there may be.<a name=
"Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></p>
<h3>PRONOMINAL ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>148.</b></span> As has been said,
<b>pronominal adjectives</b> are primarily pronouns; but, when they
<i>modify</i> words instead of referring to them as antecedents,
they are changed to adjectives. They are of two
kinds,&mdash;RELATIVE and INTERROGATIVE,&mdash;and are used to join
sentences or to ask questions, just as the corresponding pronouns
do.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Modify names of persons or
things.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>149.</b></span> The RELATIVE ADJECTIVES are
<i>which</i> and <i>what</i>; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It matters not <i>what</i> rank he has, <i>what</i> revenues or

<div class="sidenote"><i>Indefinite relative adjectives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>150.</b></span> The INDEFINITE RELATIVE
adjectives are <i>what</i>, <i>whatever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>,
<i>whichever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>. Examples of their use
are,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sn"><b>151.</b></span> The INTERROGATIVE ADJECTIVES

<h3>INFLECTIONS OF ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<p><b>153</b> .Adjectives have two inflections,&mdash;<b>number</b>
and <b>comparison</b>.</p>
<p><b>NUMBER</b>.&mdash;<b><i>This</i></b>, <b><i>That</i></b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>History of</i> this&mdash;these <i>and</i>
that&mdash;those.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>154.</b></span> The only adjectives having a
plural form are <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> (plural <i>these</i>,
<i>those</i>).</p>
<p><i>This</i> is the old demonstrative; <i>that</i> being borrowed
from the forms of the definite article, which was fully inflected
in Old English. The article <i>that</i> was used with neuter
nouns.</p>
<p>In Middle English the plural of <i>this</i> was <i>this</i> or
<i>thise</i>, which changed its spelling to the modern form
<i>these</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Those <i>borrowed from</i> this.</div>
<p>But <i>this</i> had also another plural, <i>th&#257;s</i>
(modern <i>those</i>). The old plural of <i>that</i> was <i>tha</i>
(Middle English <i>tho</i> or <i>thow</i>): consequently <i>tho</i>
(plural of <i>that</i>) and <i>those</i> (plural of <i>this</i>)
became confused, and it was forgotten that <i>those</i> was really
the plural of <i>this</i>; and in Modern English we speak of
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><i>these</i> as the plural of
<i>this</i>, and <i>those</i> as the plural of <i>that</i>.</p>
<h3>COMPARISON.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>155.</b></span> Comparison is an inflection
not possessed by nouns and pronouns: it belongs to adjectives and
adverbs.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Meaning of comparison.</i></div>
<p>When we place two objects side by side, we notice some
differences between them as to size, weight, color, etc. Thus, it
is said that a cow is <i>larger</i> than a sheep, gold is
<i>heavier</i> than iron, a sapphire is <i>bluer</i> than the sky.
All these have certain qualities; and when we compare the objects,
we do so by means of their qualities,&mdash;cow and sheep by the
quality of largeness, or size; gold and iron by the quality of
heaviness, or weight, etc.,&mdash;but not the same degree, or
amount, of the quality.</p>
<p>The degrees belong to any beings or ideas that may be known or
conceived of as possessing quality; as, "untamed thought, great,
giant-like, enormous;" "the commonest speech;" "It is a nobler
valor;" "the largest soul."</p>
<p>Also words of quantity may be compared: for example, "more
matter, with less wit;" "no fewer than a hundred."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Words that cannot be compared.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>156.</b></span> There are some descriptive
words whose meaning is such as not to admit of comparison; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>His company became very agreeable to the brave old professor of
arms, whose <i>favorite</i> pupil he was.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>A <i>main</i> difference betwixt men is, whether they attend
their own affair or not.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson</span><a name="Page_108" id=
"Page_108"></a></p>
<p>It was his business to administer the law in its <i>final</i>
and closest application to the offender<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>Freedom is a <i>perpetual, organic, universal</i> institution,
in harmony with the Constitution of the United States.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Seward.</span></p>
</div>
<p>So with the words <i>sole</i>, <i>sufficient</i>,
<i>infinite</i>, <i>immemorial</i>, <i>indefatigable</i>,
<i>indomitable</i>, <i>supreme</i>, and many others.</p>
<p>It is true that words of comparison are sometimes prefixed to
them, but, strictly considered, they are not compared.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>157.</b></span> <b>Comparison</b> means the
changes that words undergo to express degrees in quality, or
amounts in quantity.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The two forms.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>158.</b></span> There are two forms for this
inflection: the <b>comparative</b>, expressing a greater degree of
quality; and the <b>superlative</b>, expressing the greatest degree
of quality.</p>
<p>These are called <b>degrees of comparison</b>.</p>
<p>These are properly the only degrees, though the simple,
uninflected form is usually called the <b>positive degree</b>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>159.</b></span> The comparative is formed by
adding <i>-er</i>, and the superlative by adding <i>-est</i>, to
the simple form; as, <i>red</i>, <i>redder</i>, <i>reddest</i>;
<i>blue</i>, <i>bluer</i>, <i>bluest</i>; <i>easy</i>,
<i>easier</i>, <i>easiest</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Substitute for inflection in
comparison.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>160.</b></span> Side by side with these
inflected forms are found comparative and superlative expressions
making use of the adverbs <b>more</b> and <b>most</b>. These are
often useful as alternative with the inflected forms, but in most
cases are used before adjectives that are never inflected.</p>
<p><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>They came into use about
the thirteenth century, but were not common until a century
later.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Which rule</i>,&mdash; -er <i>and</i> -est
<i>or</i> more <i>and</i> most?</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>161.</b></span> The English is somewhat
capricious in choosing between the inflected forms and those with
<i>more</i> and <i>most</i>, so that no inflexible rule can be
given as to the formation of the comparative and the
superlative.</p>
<p>The general rule is, that monosyllables and easily pronounced
words of two syllables add <i>-er</i> and <i>-est</i>; and other
words are preceded by <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>.</p>
<p>But room must be left in such a rule for pleasantness of sound
and for variety of expression.</p>
<p>To see how literary English overrides any rule that could be
given, examine the following taken at random:&mdash;</p>
<p>From Thackeray: "The <i>handsomest</i> wives;" "the
<i>immensest</i> quantity of thrashing;" "the <i>wonderfulest</i>
little shoes;" "<i>more odd, strange</i>, and yet familiar;"
"<i>more austere</i> and <i>holy</i>."</p>
<p>From Ruskin: "The sharpest, finest chiseling, and
<i>patientest</i> fusing;" "<i>distantest</i> relationships;"
"<i>sorrowfulest</i> spectacles."</p>
<p>Carlyle uses <i>beautifulest</i>, <i>mournfulest</i>,
<i>honestest</i>, <i>admirablest</i>, <i>indisputablest</i>,
<i>peaceablest</i>, <i>most small</i>, etc.</p>
<p>These long, harsh forms are usually avoided, but <i>more</i> and
<i>most</i> are frequently used with monosyllables.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>162.</b></span> Expressions are often met
with in which a superlative form does not carry the superlative
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>meaning. These are equivalent
usually to <i>very</i> with the positive degree; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

benefits conferred by Spain.&mdash;<i>The Nation</i>, No 1507</p>

<p><span class="sn"><b>163.</b></span> Among the variously derived
adjectives now in our language there are some which may always be
recognized as native English. These are adjectives <b>irregularly

<h3>Remarks on Irregular Adjectives.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>List I.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>164.</b></span> (1) The word good has no
comparative or superlative, but takes the place of a positive to
<i>better</i> and <i>best</i>. There was an old comparative
<i>bet</i>, which has gone out of use; as in the sentence (14th
century), "Ich singe <i>bet</i> than thu dest" (I sing better than
thou dost). The superlative I form was <i>betst</i>, which has
softened to the modern <i>best</i>.</p>
<p>(2) In Old English, <b>evil</b> was the positive to
<i>worse</i>, <i>worst</i>; but later <i>bad</i> and <i>ill</i>
were borrowed from the Norse, and used as positives to the same
comparative and superlative. <i>Worser</i> was once used, a double
comparative; as in Shakespeare,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>O, throw away the <i>worser</i> part of it.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hamlet.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(3) <b>Little</b> is used as positive to <i>less</i>,
<i>least</i>, though from a different root. A double comparative,
<i>lesser</i>, is often used; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We have it in a much <i>lesser</i> degree.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Matthew Arnold.</span></p>
<p>Thrust the <i>lesser</i> half by main force into the fists of
Ho-ti. <span class="smcap">&mdash;Lamb.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>(4) The words <b>much</b>
and <b>many</b> now express quantity; but in former times
<i>much</i> was used in the sense of <i>large</i>, <i>great</i>,
and was the same word that is found in the proverb, "Many a little
makes <i>a mickle</i>." Its spelling has been <i>micel</i>,
<i>muchel</i>, <i>moche</i>, <i>much</i>, the parallel form
<i>mickle</i> being rarely used.</p>
<p>The meanings <i>greater</i>, <i>greatest</i>, are shown in such
phrases as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The <i>more</i> part being of one mind, to England we
sailed.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>The <i>most</i> part kept a stolid
indifference.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>The latter, meaning <i>the largest part</i>, is quite
common.</p>
<p>(5) The forms <b>elder</b>, <b>eldest</b>, are earlier than
<i>older</i>, <i>oldest</i>. A few other words with the vowel
<i>o</i> had similar change in the comparative and superlative, as
<i>long</i>, <i>strong</i>, etc.; but these have followed
<i>old</i> by keeping the same vowel <i>o</i> in all the forms,
instead of <i>lenger</i>, <i>strenger</i>, etc., the old forms.</p>
<p>(6) and (7) Both <b>nigh</b> and <b>near</b> seem regular in
Modern English, except the form <i>next</i>; but originally the
comparison was <i>nigh</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>next</i>. In the same
way the word <b>high</b> had in Middle English the superlative
<i>hexte</i>.</p>
<p>By and by the comparative <i>near</i> was regarded as a positive
form, and on it were built a double comparative <i>nearer</i>, and
the superlative <i>nearest</i>, which adds <i>-est</i> to what is
really a comparative instead of a simple adjective.</p>
<p>(8) These words also show confusion and consequent modification,
coming about as follows: <b>further</b> really belongs to another
series,&mdash;<i>forth</i>, <a name="Page_113" id=
"Page_113"></a><i>further</i>, <i>first</i>. <b>First</b> became
entirely detached from the series, and <i>furthest</i> began to be
used to follow the comparative <i>further</i>; then these were used
as comparative and superlative of <i>far</i>.</p>
<p>The word <b>far</b> had formerly the comparative and superlative
<i>farrer</i>, <i>farrest</i>. In imitation of <i>further</i>,
<i>furthest</i>, <i>th</i> came into the others, making the modern
<i>farther</i>, <i>farthest</i>. Between the two sets as they now
stand, there is scarcely any distinction, except perhaps
<i>further</i> is more used than <i>farther</i> in the sense of
<i>additional</i>; as, for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>When that evil principle was left with no <i>further</i>
material to support it.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(9) <b>Latter</b> and <b>last</b> are the older forms. Since
<i>later</i>, <i>latest</i>, came into use, a distinction has grown
up between the two series. <i>Later</i> and <i>latest</i> have the
true comparative and superlative force, and refer to time;
<i>latter</i> and <i>last</i> are used in speaking of succession,
or series, and are hardly thought of as connected in meaning with
the word <i>late</i>.</p>
<p>(10) <b>Hinder</b> is comparative in form, but not in meaning.
The form <i>hindmost</i> is really a double superlative, since the
<i>m</i> is for <i>-ma</i>, an old superlative ending, to which is
added <i>-ost</i>, doubling the inflection. <i>Hind-er-m-ost</i>
presents the combination comparative + superlative +
superlative.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>List II.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>165.</b></span> In List II. (Sec. 163) the
comparatives and superlatives are adjectives, but they have no
adjective positives.</p>
<p>The comparatives are so in form, but not in their meaning.</p>
<p>The superlatives show examples again of double <a name=
"Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>inflection, and of comparative added
to double-superlative inflection.</p>
<p>Examples (from Carlyle) of the use of these adjectives:
"revealing the <i>inner</i> splendor to him;" "a mind that has
penetrated into the <i>inmost</i> heart of a thing;" "This of
painting is one of the <i>outermost</i> developments of a man;"
"The <i>outer</i> is of the day;" "far-seeing as the sun, the
<i>upper</i> light of the world;" "the <i>innermost</i> moral
soul;" "their <i>utmost</i> exertion."</p>
<div class="sidenote">-Most <i>added to other words</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>166.</b></span> The ending <i>-most</i> is
added to some words that are not usually adjectives, or have no
comparative forms.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>There, on the very <i>topmost</i> twig, sits that ridiculous but
sweet-singing bobolink.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. W.
Beecher</span>.</p>
<p>Decidedly handsome, having such a skin as became a young woman
of family in <i>northernmost</i> Spain.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p>Highest and <i>midmost</i>, was descried The royal banner
floating wide.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>List III.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>167.</b></span> The adjectives in List III.
are like the comparative forms in List II. in having no adjective
positives. They have no superlatives, and have no comparative
force, being merely descriptive.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Her bows were deep in the water, but her <i>after</i> deck was
still dry.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>Her, by the by, in <i>after</i> years I vainly endeavored to
trace.<span class="smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p>The upper and the <i>under</i> side of the medal of
Jove.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>Have you ever considered what a deep <i>under</i> meaning there
lies in our custom of strewing flowers?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps he rose out of some <i>nether</i> region.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>Over</i> is rarely used separately as an adjective.<a name=
"Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></p>
<h3>CAUTION FOR ANALYZING OR PARSING.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Think what each adjective belongs
to.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>168.</b></span> Some care must be taken to
decide what word is modified by an adjective. In a series of
adjectives in the same sentence, all may belong to the same noun,
or each may modify a different word or group of words.</p>
<p>For example, in this sentence, "The young pastor's voice was
tremulously sweet, rich, deep, and broken," it is clear that all
four adjectives after <i>was</i> modify the noun <i>voice</i>. But
in this sentence, "She showed her usual prudence and her usual
incomparable decision," <i>decision</i> is modified by the
adjective <i>incomparable</i>; <i>usual</i> modifies
<i>incomparable decision</i>, not <i>decision</i> alone; and the
pronoun <i>her</i> limits <i>usual incomparable decision</i>.</p>
<p>Adjectives modifying the same noun are said to be of the <i>same
rank</i>; those modifying different words or word groups are said
to be adjectives of <i>different rank</i>. This distinction is
valuable in a study of punctuation.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>In the following quotations, tell what each adjective
modifies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black
eyes, it invested them with a strange remoteness and
intangibility.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>2. It may still be argued, that in the present divided state of
Christendom a college which is positively Christian must be
controlled by some religious denomination.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Noah Porter.</span></p>
<p>3. Every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood
backward to her heart.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Mrs.
Stowe.</span></p>
<p><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>4. This, our new
government, is the first in the history of the world based upon
this great physical, philosophical, and moral
truth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. H. Stephens</span></p>
<p>5. May we not, therefore, look with confidence to the ultimate
universal acknowledgment of the truths upon which our system
rests?&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
<p>6. A few improper jests and a volley of good, round, solid,
satisfactory, and heaven-defying oaths.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>7. It is well known that the announcement at any private rural
entertainment that there is to be ice cream produces an immediate
and profound impression.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Holmes.</span></p>
</div>
<h3>ADVERBS USED AS ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>169.</b></span> By a convenient brevity,
adverbs are sometimes used as adjectives; as, instead of saying,
"the one who was then king," in which <i>then</i> is an adverb, we
may say "the <i>then</i> king," making <i>then</i> an adjective.
Other instances are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>My <i>then</i> favorite, in prose, Richard Hooker.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
<p>Our <i>sometime</i> sister, now our queen.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare</span></p>
<p>Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, the <i>then</i> and <i>still</i>
owners. <span class="smcap">&mdash;Trollope.</span></p>
<p>The <i>seldom</i> use of it.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Trench.</span></p>
<p>For thy stomach's sake, and thine <i>often</i>
infirmities.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Bible.</i></span></p>
</div>
<h3>HOW TO PARSE ADJECTIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>What to tell in parsing.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>170.</b></span> Since adjectives have no
gender, person, or case, and very few have number, the method of
parsing is simple.</p>
<p>In <b>parsing</b> an adjective, tell&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The class and subclass to which it belongs.</p>
<p>(2) Its number, if it has number.</p>
<p>(3) Its degree of comparison, if it can be compared.</p>
<p>(4) What word or words it modifies.</p>
<h3><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>MODEL FOR PARSING.</h3>
<p>These truths are not unfamiliar to your thoughts.</p>
<p><i>These</i> points out <i>what</i> truths, therefore
demonstrative; plural number, having a singular, <i>this</i>;
cannot be compared; modifies the word <i>truths</i>.</p>
<p><i>Unfamiliar</i> describes <i>truths</i>, therefore
descriptive; not inflected for number; compared by prefixing
<i>more</i> and <i>most</i>; positive degree; modifies
<i>truths</i>.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Parse in full each adjective in these sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. A thousand lives seemed concentrated in that one moment to
Eliza.</p>
<p>2. The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched
and creaked.</p>

<p>4. She made no reply, and I waited for none.</p>
<p>5. A herd of thirty or forty tall ungainly figures took their
way, with awkward but rapid pace, across the plain.</p>

<h2><a name="ARTICLES" id="ARTICLES"></a><b>ARTICLES.</b></h2>
<p><span class="sn"><b>171.</b></span> There is a class of words
having always an adjectival use in general, but with such subtle
functions and various meanings that they deserve separate
treatment. In the sentence, "He passes an ordinary brick house on
the road, with an ordinary little garden," the words <i>the</i> and
<i>an</i> belong to nouns, just as adjectives do; but they cannot
be accurately placed under any class of adjectives. They are
nearest to demonstrative and numeral adjectives.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Their origin.</i></div>
<p>172. The article <b>the</b> comes from an old demonstrative
adjective (<i>s&#275;</i>, <i>s&#275;o</i>, <i>&eth;at</i>, later
<i>th&#275;</i>, <i>th&#275;o</i>, <i>that</i>) which was also an
article in Old English. In Middle English <i>the</i> became an
article, and <i>that</i> remained a demonstrative adjective.</p>
<p><b>An</b> or <b>a</b> came from the old numeral <i>&#257;n</i>,
meaning <i>one</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Two relics.</i></div>
<p>Our expressions <i>the one</i>, <i>the other</i>, were formerly
<i>that one</i>, <i>that other</i>; the latter is still preserved
in the expression, in vulgar English, <i>the tother</i>. Not only
this is kept in the Scotch dialect, but the former is used, these
occurring as <i>the tane, the tother</i>, or <i>the tane, the
tither</i>; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We ca' her sometimes <i>the tane</i>, sometimes <i>the
tother</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">An <i>before vowel sounds</i>, a <i>before
consonant sounds</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>173.</b></span> Ordinarily <i>an</i> is used
before vowel sounds, and <i>a</i> before consonant sounds. Remember
that a <i>vowel sound</i> does not necessarily mean beginning with
a vowel, nor does <i>consonant sound</i> mean <a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120"></a>beginning with a consonant, because English
spelling does not coincide closely with the sound of words.
Examples: "<i>a</i> house," "<i>an</i> orange," "<i>a</i>
European," "<i>an</i> honor," "<i>a</i> yelling crowd."</p>
<div class="sidenote">An <i>with consonant sounds</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>174.</b></span> Many writers use <i>an</i>
before <i>h</i>, even when not silent, when the word is not
accented on the first syllable.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>175.</b></span> An <b>article</b> is a
limiting word, not descriptive, which cannot be used alone, but
always joins to a substantive word to denote a particular thing, or
a group or class of things, or any individual of a group or
class.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Kinds.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>176.</b></span> Articles are either
<b>definite</b> or <b>indefinite</b>.</p>
<p><b>The</b> is the definite article, since it points out a
particular individual, or group, or class.</p>
<p><b>An</b> or <b>a</b> is the indefinite article, because it
refers to any one of a group or class of things.</p>
<p><b>An</b> and <b>a</b> are different forms of the same word, the
older <i>&#257;n</i>.</p>
<h3>USES OF THE DEFINITE ARTICLE.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Reference to a known object.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>177.</b></span> The most common use of the
definite article is to refer to an object that the listener or

with; as in the sentence,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote"><i>With names of rivers.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>178.</b></span> <i>The</i> is often prefixed
to the names of rivers; and when the word <i>river</i> is omitted,

one thing delightful, and implies others having the same

<h2><a name="VERBS_AND_VERBALS" id="VERBS_AND_VERBALS"></a><b>VERBS
AND VERBALS.</b>.</h2>
<h2><a name="VERBS" id="VERBS"></a>VERBS.</h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Verb,&mdash;the word of the
sentence.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>199.</b></span> The term <i>verb</i> is from
the Latin <i>verbum</i> meaning <i>word</i>: hence it is <i>the</i>
word of a sentence. A thought cannot be expressed without a verb.
When the child cries, "Apple!" it means, <i>See</i> the apple! or I
<i>have</i> an apple! In the mariner's shout, "A sail!" the meaning
is, "Yonder <i>is</i> a sail!"</p>
<p>Sentences are in the form of declarations, questions, or
commands; and none of these can be put before the mind without the
use of a verb.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>One group or a group of words.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>200.</b></span> The verb may not always be a
single word. On account of the lack of inflections, <i>verb
phrases</i> are very frequent. Hence the verb may consist of:</p>
<p><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>(1) <i>One word</i>; as,
"The young man <i>obeyed</i>."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Several words of verbal nature, making one
expression</i>; as, (<i>a</i>) "Some day it <i>may be
considered</i> reasonable," (<i>b</i>) "Fearing lest he <i>might
have been anticipated</i>."</p>
<p>(3) <i>One or more verbal words united with other words to
compose one verb phrase</i>: as in the sentences, (<i>a</i>) "They
knew well that this woman <i>ruled over</i> thirty millions of
subjects;" (<i>b</i>) "If all the flummery and extravagance of an
army <i>were done away with</i>, the money could be made to go much
further;" (<i>c</i>) "It is idle cant to pretend anxiety for the
better distribution of wealth until we can devise means by which
this preying upon people of small incomes <i>can be put a stop
to</i>."</p>
<p>In (<i>a</i>), a verb and a preposition are used as one verb; in
(<i>b</i>), a verb, an adverb, and a preposition unite as a verb;
in (<i>c</i>), an article, a noun, a preposition, are united with
verbs as one verb phrase.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition and caution.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>201.</b></span> A <b>verb</b> is a word used
as a predicate, to say something to or about some person or thing.
In giving a definition, we consider a verb as one word.</p>
<p>Now, it is indispensable to the nature of a verb that it is "a
word used as a predicate." Examine the sentences in Sec. 200: In
(1), <i>obeyed</i> is a predicate; in (2, <i>a</i>), <i>may be
considered</i> is a unit in doing the work of one predicate; in (2,
<i>b</i>), <i>might have been anticipated</i> is also one
predicate, but <i>fearing</i> is not a predicate, hence is not a
verb; in (3, <i>b</i>), <i>to go</i> is no predicate, and not a
verb; in (3, <i>c</i>), <i>to pretend</i> and <i>preying</i> have
something of <a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>verbal nature in
expressing action in a faint and general way, but cannot be
predicates.</p>
<p>In the sentence, "<i>Put</i> money in thy purse," <i>put</i> is
the predicate, with some word understood; as, "Put <i>thou</i>
money in thy purse."</p>
<h3>VERBS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO MEANING AND USE.</h3>
<h3>TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE VERBS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The nature of the transitive
verb.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>202.</b></span> By examining a few verbs, it
may be seen that not all verbs are used alike. All do not express
action: some denote state or condition. Of those expressing action,
all do not express it in the same way; for example, in this
sentence from Bulwer,&mdash;"The proud lone <i>took</i> care to
conceal the anguish she <i>endured</i>; and the pride of woman
<i>has</i> an hypocrisy which <i>can deceive</i> the most
penetrating, and <i>shame</i> the most astute,"&mdash;every one of
the verbs in Italics has one or more words before or after it,
representing something which it influences or controls. In the
first, lone <i>took</i> what? answer, <i>care</i>; <i>endured</i>
what? <i>anguish</i>; etc. Each influences some object, which may
be a person, or a material thing, or an idea. <i>Has</i> takes the
object <i>hypocrisy</i>; <i>can deceive</i> has an object, <i>the
most penetrating</i>; (can) <i>shame</i> also has an object, <i>the
most astute</i>.</p>
<p>In each case, the word following, or the object, is necessary to
the completion of the action expressed in the verb.</p>
<p>All these are called transitive verbs, from the Latin
<i>transire</i>, which means <i>to go over</i>. Hence</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_131" id=
"Page_131"></a><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>203.</b></span> A transitive verb is one
which must have an object to complete its meaning, and to receive
the action expressed.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The nature of intransitive
verbs.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>204.</b></span> Examine the verbs in the
following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>She <i>sprang up</i> at that thought, and, taking the staff
which always guided her steps, she <i>hastened</i> to the
neighboring shrine of Isis. Till she <i>had been</i> under the
guardianship of the kindly Greek, that staff <i>had sufficed</i> to
conduct the poor blind girl from corner to corner of
Pompeii.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bulwer</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this there are some verbs unlike those that have been
examined. <i>Sprang</i>, or <i>sprang up</i>, expresses action, but
it is complete in itself, does not affect an object;
<i>hastened</i> is similar in use; <i>had been</i> expresses
condition, or state of being, and can have no object; <i>had
sufficed</i> means <i>had been sufficient</i>, and from its meaning
cannot have an object.</p>
<p>Such verbs are called intransitive (not crossing over).
Hence</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>205.</b></span> An intransitive verb is one
which is complete in itself, or which is completed by other words
without requiring an object.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Study</i> use, <i>not</i> form, <i>of
verbs here.</i></div>
<p>206. Many verbs can be either transitive or intransitive,
according to their use in the sentence, It can be said, "The boy
<i>walked</i> for two hours," or "The boy <i>walked</i> the horse;"
"The rains <i>swelled</i> the river," or "The river <i>swelled</i>
because of the rain;" etc.</p>
<p>The important thing to observe is, many words must be
distinguished as transitive or intransitive by <i>use</i>, not by
<i>form</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class=
"sn"><b>207.</b></span> Also verbs are sometimes made transitive by
prepositions. These may be (1) compounded with the verb; or (2) may
follow the verb, and be used as an integral part of it: for
example,&mdash;</p>

<h3>VOICE, ACTIVE AND PASSIVE.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Meaning of active voice.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>208.</b></span> As has been seen, transitive
verbs are the only kind that can express action so as to go over to
an object. This implies three things,&mdash;the agent, or person or
thing acting; the verb representing the action; the person or
object receiving the act.</p>
<p>In the sentence, "We reached the village of Sorgues by dusk, and
accepted the invitation of an old dame to lodge at her inn," these
three things are found: the actor, or agent, is expressed by
<i>we</i>; the action is asserted by <i>reached</i> and
<i>accepted</i>; the things acted upon are <i>village</i> and
<i>invitation</i>. Here the subject is represented as doing
something. The same word is the subject and the agent. This use of
a transitive verb is called the <b>active voice</b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>209.</b></span> The <b>active voice</b> is
that form of a verb which represents the subject as acting; or</p>
<p>The active voice is that form of a transitive verb which makes
the <i>subject</i> and the <i>agent</i> the same word.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><i>A
question.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>210.</b></span> Intransitive verbs are
<i>always active voice</i>. Let the student explain why.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Meaning of passive voice.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>211.</b></span> In the assertion of an
action, it would be natural to suppose, that, instead of always
representing the subject as acting upon some person or thing, it
must often happen that the subject is spoken of as <i>acted
upon</i>; and the person or thing acting may or may not be
expressed in the sentence: for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are
speedily punished. They are punished by fear.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here the subject <i>infractions</i> does nothing: it represents
the object toward which the action of <i>are punished</i> is
directed, yet it is the subject of the same verb. In the first
sentence the agent is not expressed; in the second, <i>fear</i> is
the agent of the same action.</p>
<p>So that in this case, instead of having the agent and subject
the same word, we have the <i>object</i> and <i>subject</i> the
same word, and the agent may be omitted from the statement of the
action.</p>
<p><i>Passive</i> is from the Latin word <i>patior</i>, meaning
<i>to endure</i> or <i>suffer</i>; but in ordinary grammatical use
<i>passive</i> means <i>receiving an action</i>.</p>

<h3>MOOD.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>213.</b></span> The word <i>mood</i> is from
the Latin <i>modus</i>, meaning <i>manner</i>, <i>way</i>,
<i>method</i>. Hence, when applied to verbs,&mdash;</p>
<p><b>Mood</b> means the manner of conceiving and expressing action
or being of some subject.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><i>The
three ways.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>214.</b></span> There are three chief ways
of expressing action or being:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) As a fact; this may be a question, statement, or
assumption.</p>
<p>(2) As doubtful, or merely conceived of in the mind.</p>
<p>(3) As urged or commanded.</p>
<h3>INDICATIVE MOOD.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Deals with facts.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>215.</b></span> The term <i>indicative</i>
is from the Latin <i>indicare</i> (to declare, or assert). The
indicative represents something as a fact,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Affirms or denies.</i></div>
<p>(1) <i>By declaring a thing to be true or not to be true</i>;
thus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution.</i></div>
<p>(2) <i>By assuming a thing to be true</i> without declaring it
to be so. This kind of indicative clause is usually introduced by
<i>if</i> (meaning <i>admitting that, granting that</i>, etc.),
<i>though, although</i>, etc. Notice that the action is not merely
conceived as possible; it is assumed to be a fact: for
example,&mdash;</p>

<h3>SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Meaning of the word.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>217.</b></span> <i>Subjunctive</i> means
<i>subjoined</i>, or joined as dependent or subordinate to
something else.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>This meaning is misleading.</i></div>
<p>If its original meaning be closely adhered to, we must expect
every dependent clause to have its verb in the subjunctive mood,
and every clause <i>not</i> dependent to have its verb in some
other mood.</p>
<p>But this is not the case. In the quotation from Hamilton (Sec.
215, 2) several subjoined clauses introduced by <i>if</i> have the
indicative mood, and also independent clauses are often found
having the verb in the subjunctive mood.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Cautions.</i></div>
<p>Three cautions will be laid down which must be observed by a
student who wishes to understand and use the English
subjunctive:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) You cannot tell it always by the form of the word. The main
difference is, that the subjunctive has no <i>-s</i> as the ending
of the present tense, third person singular; as, "If he
<i>come</i>."</p>
<p>(2) The fact that its clause is dependent or is introduced by
certain words will not be a safe rule to guide you.</p>
<p>(3) The <i>meaning</i> of the verb itself must be keenly
studied.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_138" id=
"Page_138"></a><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>218.</b></span> The subjunctive mood is that
form or use of the verb which expresses action or being, not as a
fact, but as merely conceived of in the mind.</p>

<h3>Subjunctive in Dependent Clauses.</h3>
<h3>I. Condition or Supposition.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>221.</b></span> The most common way of
representing the action or being as merely thought of, is by
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>putting it into the form of a
<i>supposition</i> or <i>condition</i>; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<h3>STUDY OF CONDITIONAL SENTENCES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>222.</b></span> There are three kinds of
conditional sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Real or true.</i></div>
<p>(1) Those in which an assumed or admitted fact is placed before
the mind in the form of a condition (see Sec. 215, 2); for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If they <i>were</i> unacquainted with the works of philosophers
and poets, they were deeply read in the oracles of God. If their
names <i>were not found</i> in the registers of heralds, they were

"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Ideal,&mdash;may or may not be
true.</i></div>
<p>(2) Those in which the condition depends on something uncertain,
and <i>may or may not be regarded true, or be fulfilled</i>;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

by distinction society, he will see the need of these ethics.
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140"></a><i>Unreal&mdash;cannot be true.</i></div>
<p>(3) Suppositions <i>contrary to fact</i>, which cannot be true,
or conditions that cannot be fulfilled, but are presented only in
order to suggest what <i>might be</i> or <i>might have been</i>
true; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If these things <i>were</i> true, society could not hold

me.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Franklin.</span></p>

<i>striven</i> energetically to save Ney, it <i>would have cast</i>
such an enhancing light over all his glories, that we cannot but
regret its absence.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bayne.</span></p>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;Conditional sentences are usually introduced by
<i>if</i>, <i>though</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>unless</i>, etc.; but
when the verb precedes the subject, the conjunction is often
omitted: for example, "<i>Were I bidden</i> to say how the highest
genius could be most advantageously employed," etc.</p>

<h3>II. Subjunctive of Purpose.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>223.</b></span> The subjunctive, especially

</div>
<h3>IV. In Temporal Clauses.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>225.</b></span> The English subjunctive,
like the Latin, is sometimes used in a clause to express the time
when an action is to take place.<a name="Page_142" id=

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Let it rise, till it <i>meet</i> the sun in his

</div>
<h3>VI. Expressing a Wish.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>227.</b></span> After a verb of wishing, the

<h3>Prevalence of the Subjunctive Mood.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>230.</b></span> As shown by the wide range
of literature from which these examples are selected, the
subjunctive is very much used in literary English, especially by
those who are artistic and exact in the expression of their
thought.</p>
<p><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>At the present day,
however, the subjunctive is becoming less and less used. Very many
of the sentences illustrating the use of the subjunctive mood could
be replaced by numerous others using the indicative to express the
same thoughts.</p>
<p>The three uses of the subjunctive now most frequent are, to
express a wish, a concession, and condition contrary to fact.</p>
<p>In spoken English, the subjunctive <i>were</i> is much used in a
wish or a condition contrary to fact, but hardly any other
subjunctive forms are.</p>
<p>It must be remembered, though, that many of the verbs in the
subjunctive have the same form as the indicative. Especially is
this true of unreal conditions in past time; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Were we of open sense as the Greeks were, we <i>had found</i>
[should have found] a poem here.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>

<h3>IMPERATIVE MOOD.</h3>

requests.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Usually second person.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>232.</b></span> The imperative is naturally
used mostly with the <b>second person</b>, since commands are

<p>But the imperative may be used with the plural of the first

but I + you, or I + they, etc., we may use the imperative with
<i>we</i> in a command, request, etc., to <i>you</i> implied in it.

</div>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Find sentences with five verbs in the indicative
mood, five in the subjunctive, five in the imperative.</p>
<h3>TENSE.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>233.</b></span> <i>Tense</i> means
<i>time</i>. The <b>tense</b> of a verb is the form or use
indicating the time of an action or being.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Tenses in English.</i></div>
<p>Old English had only two tenses,&mdash;the present tense, which
represented present and future time; and the past tense. We still
use the present for the future in such expressions as, "I <i>go</i>
away to-morrow;" "If he <i>comes</i>, tell him to wait."</p>
<p>But English of the present day not only has a tense for each of
the natural time divisions,&mdash;present, past, and
future,&mdash;but has other tenses to correspond with those of
highly inflected languages, such as Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>The distinct inflections are found only in the present and past
tenses, however: the others are <a name="Page_148" id=
"Page_148"></a>compounds of verbal forms with various helping
verbs, called <b>auxiliaries</b>; such as <i>be</i>, <i>have</i>,
<i>shall</i>, <i>will</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The tenses in detail.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>234.</b></span> Action or being may be
represented as occurring in present, past, or future time, by means
of the <b>present</b>, the <b>past</b>, and the <b>future
tense</b>. It may also be represented as <i>finished</i> in present
or past or future time by means of the present perfect, past
perfect, and future perfect tenses.</p>
<p>Not only is this so: there are what are called <b>definite
forms</b> of these tenses, showing more exactly the time of the
action or being. These make the English speech even more exact than
other languages, as will be shown later on, in the
conjugations.</p>
<h3>PERSON AND NUMBER.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>235.</b></span> The English verb has never
had full inflections for number and person, as the classical
languages have.</p>
<p>When the older pronoun <i>thou</i> was in use, there was a form
of the verb to correspond to it, or agree with it, as, "Thou
walk<i>est</i>," present; "Thou walked<i>st</i>," past; also, in
the third person singular, a form ending in -<i>eth</i>, as, "It is
not in man that walk<i>eth</i>, to direct his steps."</p>
<p>But in ordinary English of the present day there is practically
only one ending for person and number. This is the third person,
singular number; as, "He walk<i>s</i>;" and this only in the
present tense indicative. This is important in questions of
agreement when we come to syntax.<a name="Page_149" id=
"Page_149"></a></p>
<h3>CONJUGATION.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>236.</b></span> <b>Conjugation</b> is the
regular arrangement of the forms of the verb in the various voices,
moods, tenses, persons, and numbers.</p>
<p>In classical languages, <b>conjugation</b> means <i>joining
together</i> the numerous endings to the stem of the verb; but in
English, inflections are so few that conjugation means merely the
exhibition of the forms and the different verb phrases that express
the relations of voice, mood, tense, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Few forms.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>237.</b></span> Verbs in modern English have
only four or five forms; for example, <i>walk</i> has <i>walk</i>,
<i>walks</i>, <i>walked</i>, <i>walking</i>, sometimes adding the
old forms <i>walkest</i>, <i>walkedst</i>, <i>walketh</i>. Such
verbs as <i>choose</i> have five,&mdash;<i>choose</i>,
<i>chooses</i>, <i>chose</i>, <i>choosing</i>, <i>chosen</i> (old,
<i>choosest</i>, <i>chooseth</i>, <i>chosest</i>).</p>
<p>The verb <i>be</i> has more forms, since it is composed of
several different roots,&mdash;<i>am</i>, <i>are</i>, <i>is</i>,
<i>were</i>, <i>been</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>VERBS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO FORM.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Kinds.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>244.</b></span> According to form, verbs are
<b>strong</b> or <b>weak</b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p>A <b>strong verb</b> forms its past tense by changing the vowel
of the present tense form, but adds no ending; as, <i>run</i>,
<i>ran</i>; <i>drive</i>, <i>drove</i>.</p>
<p>A <b>weak verb</b> always adds an ending to the present to form
the past tense, and <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> change the vowel:
as, <i>beg</i>, <i>begged</i>; <i>lay</i>, <i>laid</i>;
<i>sleep</i>, <i>slept</i>; <i>catch</i>, <i>caught</i>.</p>

<h3>Remarks on Certain Verb Forms.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>246.</b></span> Several of the perfect
participles are seldom used except as adjectives: as, "his
<i>bounden</i> duty," "the <i>cloven</i> hoof," "a <i>drunken</i>
wretch," "a <i>sunken</i> snag." <i>Stricken</i> is used mostly of
diseases; as, "<i>stricken</i> with paralysis."</p>
<p>The verb <b>bear</b> (to bring forth) is peculiar in having one
participle (<i>borne</i>) for the active, and another (<i>born</i>)
for the passive. When it means <i>to carry</i> or to <i>endure</i>,
<i>borne</i> is also a passive.</p>
<p>The form <b>clomb</b> is not used in prose, but is much used in
vulgar English, and sometimes occurs in poetry; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Thou hast <i>clomb</i> aloft.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth</span></p>
<p>Or pine grove whither woodman never <i>clomb</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Coleridge</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>The forms of <b>cleave</b>
are really a mixture of two verbs,&mdash;one meaning <i>to
adhere</i> or <i>cling</i>; the other, <i>to split</i>. The former
used to be <i>cleave</i>, <i>cleaved</i>, <i>cleaved</i>; and the
latter, <i>cleave</i>, <i>clave</i> or <i>clove</i>, <i>cloven</i>.
But the latter took on the weak form <i>cleft</i> in the past tense
and past participle,&mdash;as (from Shakespeare), "O Hamlet! thou
hast <i>cleft</i> my heart in twain,"&mdash;while <i>cleave</i> (to
cling) sometimes has <i>clove</i>, as (from Holmes), "The old Latin
tutor <i>clove</i> to Virgilius Maro." In this confusion of usage,
only one set remains certain,&mdash;<i>cleave</i>, <i>cleft</i>,
<i>cleft</i> (to split).</p>
<p><b>Crew</b> is seldom found in present-day English.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Not a cock <i>crew</i>, nor a dog barked.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Irving.</span></p>
<p>Our cock, which always <i>crew</i> at eleven, now told us it was
time for repose.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Historically, <b>drunk</b> is the one correct past participle of
the verb <i>drink</i>. But <i>drunk</i> is very much used as an
adjective, instead of <i>drunken</i> (meaning intoxicated); and,
probably to avoid confusion with this, <b>drank</b> is a good deal
used as a past participle: thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We had each <i>drank</i> three times at the
well.&mdash;<span class="smcap">B. Taylor</span>.</p>
<p>This liquor <i>was</i> generally <i>drank</i> by Wood and
Billings. <span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes in literary English, especially in that of an earlier
period, it is found that the verb <b>eat</b> has the past tense and
past participle <i>eat</i> (&#277;t), instead of <i>ate</i> and
<i>eaten</i>; as, for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It ate the food it ne'er had <i>eat</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Coleridge.</span></p>
<p>How fairy Mab the junkets <i>eat</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Milton.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The island princes overbold<br /></span>
<span>Have <i>eat</i> our substance.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Tennyson.</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>This is also very much used
in spoken and vulgar English.</p>
<p>The form <b>gotten</b> is little used, <i>got</i> being the
preferred form of past participle as well as past tense. One
example out of many is,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We <i>had</i> all <i>got</i> safe on shore.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Foe.</span></p>
</div>
<p><b>Hung</b> and <b>hanged</b> both are used as the past tense
and past participle of <i>hang</i>; but <i>hanged</i> is the
preferred form when we speak of execution by hanging; as,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The butler <i>was hanged</i>.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap"><i>Bible.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>The verb <b>sat</b> is sometimes spelled <i>sate</i>; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Might we have <i>sate</i> and talked where gowans
blow.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></p>
<p>He <i>sate</i> him down, and seized a pen.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Byron.</span></p>
<p>"But I <i>sate</i> still and finished my plaiting."<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Usually <b>shear</b> is a weak verb. <i>Shorn</i> and
<i>shore</i> are not commonly used: indeed, <i>shore</i> is rare,
even in poetry.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>This heard Geraint, and grasping at his
sword,<br /></span> <span><i>Shore</i> thro' the swarthy
neck.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Tennyson.</span></div>
</div>
<p><i>Shorn</i> is used sometimes as a participial adjective, as "a
<i>shorn</i> lamb," but not much as a participle. We usually say,
"The sheep were <i>sheared</i>" instead of "The sheep were
<i>shorn</i>."</p>
<p><b>Went</b> is borrowed as the past tense of <i>go</i> from the
old verb <i>wend</i>, which is seldom used except in poetry; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>If, maiden, thou would'st <i>wend</i>
with me<br /></span> <span>To leave both tower and
town.<br /></span> <span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></div>
</div>

<h3>DEFECTIVE STRONG VERBS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>247.</b></span> There are several verbs
which are lacking in one or more principal parts. They are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table>
<p><span class="sn"><b>248.</b></span> May is used as either
indicative or subjunctive, as it has two meanings. It is indicative
when it expresses <i>permission</i>, or, as it sometimes does,
<i>ability</i>, like the word <i>can</i>: it is subjunctive when it
expresses doubt as to the reality of an action, or when it
expresses wish, purpose, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_161" id=

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If I <i>may</i> lightly employ the Miltonic figure, "far off his
coming shines."<span class="smcap">&mdash;Winier.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">

<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And from her fair and unpolluted
flesh<br /></span> <span><i>May</i> violets spring!<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></div>
</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>249.</b></span> <b>Can</b> is used in the
indicative only. The <i>l</i> in <i>could</i> did not belong there
originally, but came through analogy with <i>should</i> and
<i>would</i>. <i>Could</i> may be subjunctive, as in Sec. 220.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>250.</b></span> <b>Must</b> is historically
a past-tense form, from the obsolete verb <i>motan</i>, which
survives in the sentence, "So <i>mote</i> it be." <i>Must</i> is
present or past tense, according to the infinitive used.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>All <i>must concede</i> to him a sublime power of
action.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Channing</span></p>
<p>This, of course, <i>must have been</i> an ocular

</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>251.</b></span> The same remarks apply to
<b>ought</b>, which is historically the past tense of the verb
<i>owe</i>. Like <i>must</i>, it is used only in the indicative
mood; as,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The just imputations on our own faith <i>ought</i> first <i>to
be removed</i>.... Have we valuable territories and important
posts...which <i>ought</i> long since <i>to have been
surrendered</i>?&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Hamilton.</span></p>
</div>
<p>It will be noticed that all the other defective verbs take the
pure infinitive without <i>to</i>, while <i>ought</i> always has
<i>to</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><b>Shall and
Will.</b></h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>252.</b></span> The principal trouble in the
use of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i> is the disposition, especially
in the United States, to use <i>will</i> and <i>would</i>, to the
neglect of <i>shall</i> and <i>should</i>, with pronouns of the
first person; as, "I think I <i>will</i> go."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Uses of</i> shall <i>and</i> should.</div>
<p>The following distinctions must be observed:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) With the FIRST PERSON, shall and should are used,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Futurity and questions&mdash;first
person.</i></div>
<p>(<i>a</i>) In making simple statements or predictions about
future time; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The time will come full soon, I <i>shall</i> be
gone.&mdash;<span class="smcap">L. C. Moulton</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>(<i>b</i>) In questions asking for orders, or implying
obligation or authority resting upon the subject; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>With respect to novels, what <i>shall</i> I
say?&mdash;<span class="smcap">N. Webster</span>.</p>
<p>How <i>shall</i> I describe the luster which at that moment
burst upon my vision?&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. Brockden
Brown</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Second and third persons.</i></div>
<p>(2) With the SECOND AND THIRD PERSONS, <i>shall</i> and
<i>should</i> are used,&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To express authority, in the form of command,
promise, or confident prediction. The following are
examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Never mind, my lad, whilst I live thou <i>shalt</i> never want a
friend to stand by thee.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Irving.</span></p>
<p>They <i>shall</i> have venison to eat, and corn to
hoe.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Cooper.</span></p>
<p>The sea <i>shall</i> crush thee; yea, the ponderous wave up the
loose beach <i>shall</i> grind and scoop thy grave.<span class=

</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>She <i>should</i> not walk, he said,
through the dust and heat of<br /></span> <span>the

queen, not plod along like a<br /></span>
<span>peasant.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Longfellow.</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>(<i>b</i>) In <i>indirect
quotations</i>, to express the same idea that the original speaker
put forth (i.e., future action); for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>He declares that he <i>shall</i> win the purse from
you.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bulwer.</span></p>
<p>She rejects his suit with scorn, but assures him that she
<i>shall</i> make great use of her power over him.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
<p>Fielding came up more and more bland and smiling, with the
conviction that he <i>should</i> win in the end.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap">A. Larned</span>.</p>
<p>Those who had too presumptuously concluded that they
<i>should</i> pass without combat were something
disconcerted.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(<i>c</i>) With <i>direct questions</i> of the second person,
when the answer expected would express simple futurity;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>Should</i> you like to go to school at
Canterbury?"<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dickens.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>First, second and third persons.</i></div>
<p>(3) With ALL THREE PERSONS,&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Should</i> is used with the meaning of obligation,
and is equivalent to <i>ought</i>.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I never was what I <i>should</i> be.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap">H. James, Jr</span>.</p>
<p>Milton! thou <i>should'st</i> be living at this

<p>He <i>should</i> not flatter himself with the delusion that he
can make or unmake the reputation of other men.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Winter.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Shall</i> and <i>should</i> are both used in
<i>dependent clauses</i> of condition, time, purpose, etc.; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i6">When thy mind<br /></span>
<span><i>Shall</i> be a mansion for all stately forms.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">

blundering and untrue, would any one wonder?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>Jealous lest the sky <i>should</i> have a listener.<span class=

<p>If thou <i>should'st</i> ever come by chance or choice to
Modena.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Rogers.</span><a name="Page_164"

<p>If I <i>should</i> be where I no more can hear thy

<p>That accents and looks so winning <i>should</i> disarm me of my
resolution, was to be expected.&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. B.
Brown</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>253.</b></span> <b>Will</b> and <b>would</b>
are used as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Authority as to future action&mdash;first
person.</i></div>
<p>(1) With the FIRST PERSON, <i>will</i> and <i>would</i> are used
to express determination as to the future, or a promise; as, for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I <i>will</i> go myself now, and <i>will</i> not return until
all is finished.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Cable.</span></p>
<p>And promised...that I <i>would</i> do him justice, as the sole
inventor.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Disguising a command.</i></div>
<p>(2) With the SECOND PERSON, <i>will</i> is used to express
command. This puts the order more mildly, as if it were merely
expected action; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Thou <i>wilt</i> take the skiff, Roland, and two of my
people,... and fetch off certain plate and belongings.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>

practicable, and mark on the grounds the works, etc.&mdash;<i>War
Records.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Mere futurity.</i></div>
<p>(3) With both SECOND AND THIRD PERSONS, <i>will</i> and

expected to occur; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>All this <i>will</i> sound wild and chimerical.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Burke.</span></p>
<p>She <i>would</i> tell you that punishment is the reward of the

<p>When I am in town, <i>you'll</i> always have somebody to sit
with you. To be sure, so you <i>will</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Dickens.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(4) With FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD PERSONS, <i>would</i> is used
to express a <i>wish</i>,&mdash;the original meaning of the word
<i>will</i>; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Subject</i> I <i>omitted: often
so.</i></div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Would</i> that a momentary emanation from thy glory would
visit me!&mdash;<span class="smcap">C. B. Brown</span>.<a name=

<p>Thine was a dangerous gift, when thou wast born, The gift of

me for the use of it.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
<p>What <i>wouldst</i> thou have a good great man
obtain?<span class="smcap">&mdash;Coleridge.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(5) With the THIRD PERSON, <i>will</i> and <i>would</i> often
denote an action as customary, without regard to future time;
as,</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>They <i>will</i> go to Sunday schools, through storms their
brothers are afraid of.... They <i>will</i> stand behind a table at
a fair all day.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Holmes</span></p>
<p>On a slight suspicion, they <i>would</i> cut off the hands of

<p>(<i>a</i>) From Secs. 252 and 253, write out a summary or
outline of the various uses of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Examine the following sentences, and justify the use
of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, or correct them if wrongly
used:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><b>WEAK VERBS.</b></p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>255.</b></span> Those weak verbs which add
<i>-d</i> or <i>-ed</i> to form the past tense and past participle,
and have no change of vowel, are so easily recognized as to need no
special treatment. Some of them are already given as secondary
forms of the strong verbs.</p>
<p>But the rest, which may be called <b>irregular weak verbs</b>,
need some attention and explanation.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>256.</b></span> The irregular weak verbs are
divided into two classes,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The two classes of irregular weak
verbs.</i></div>
<p>(1) Those which retain the <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i> in the past
tense, with some change of form for the past tense and past
participle.</p>
<p>(2) Those which end in <i>-d</i> or <i>-t</i>, and have lost the
ending which formerly was added to this.</p>
<p>The old ending to verbs of Class II. was <i>-de</i> or

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tendency to phonetic spelling.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>250.</b></span> There seems to be in Modern
English a growing tendency toward phonetic spelling in the past
tense and past participle of weak verbs. For <a name="Page_170" id=
"Page_170"></a>example, <i>-ed</i>, after the verb <i>bless</i>,
has the sound of <i>t</i>: hence the word is often written
<i>blest</i>. So with <i>dipt</i>, <i>whipt</i>, <i>dropt</i>,
<i>tost</i>, <i>crost</i>, <i>drest</i>, <i>prest</i>, etc. This is
often seen in poetry, and is increasing in prose.</p>
<h3>Some Troublesome Verbs.</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Lie <i>and</i> lay <i>in use and
meaning.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>260.</b></span> Some sets of verbs are often
confused by young students, weak forms being substituted for
correct, strong forms.</p>
<p><b>Lie</b> and <b>lay</b> need close attention. These are the
forms:&mdash;</p>

</table>
<p>The distinctions to be observed are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Lie</i>, with its forms, is regularly <i>intransitive</i>
as to use. As to meaning, <i>lie</i> means to rest, to recline, to
place one's self in a recumbent position; as, "There <i>lies</i>
the ruin."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Lay</i>, with its forms, is always <i>transitive</i> as
to use. As to meaning, <i>lay</i> means to put, to place a person
or thing in position; as, "Slowly and sadly we <i>laid</i> him
down." Also <i>lay</i> may be used without any object expressed,
but there is still a transitive meaning; as in the expressions, "to
<i>lay</i> up for future use," "to <i>lay</i> on with the rod," "to
<i>lay</i> about him lustily."</p>
<div class="sidenote">Sit <i>and</i> set.</div>

<p><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>Notice these points of
difference between the two verbs:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Sit</i>, with its forms, is always <i>intransitive</i> in
use. In meaning, <i>sit</i> signifies (<i>a</i>) to place one's
self on a seat, to rest; (<i>b</i>) to be adjusted, to fit;
(<i>c</i>) to cover and warm eggs for hatching, as, "The hen
<i>sits</i>."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Set</i>, with its forms, is always <i>transitive</i> in
use when it has the following meanings: (<i>a</i>) to put or place
a thing or person in position, as "He <i>set</i> down the book;"
(<i>b</i>) to fix or establish, as, "He <i>sets</i> a good
example."</p>
<p><i>Set</i> is <i>intransitive</i> when it means (<i>a</i>) to go
down, to decline, as, "The sun has <i>set</i>;" (<i>b</i>) to
become fixed or rigid, as, "His eyes <i>set</i> in his head because
of the disease;" (<i>c</i>) in certain idiomatic expressions, as,
for example, "to <i>set</i> out," "to <i>set</i> up in business,"
"to <i>set</i> about a thing," "to <i>set</i> to work," "to
<i>set</i> forward," "the tide <i>sets</i> in," "a strong wind
<i>set</i> in," etc.</p>

<p><span class="sn"><b>268.</b></span> In Sec. 267 the word
<i>to</i> is printed in brackets because it is not a necessary part
of the infinitive.</p>
<p>It originally belonged only to an inflected form of the
infinitive, expressing purpose; as in the Old English, "&#362;t
&#275;ode se s&#483;dere his s&aelig;d t&#333; s&#257;wenne" (Out
went the sower his seed <i>to sow</i>).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Cases when</i> to <i>is omitted.</i></div>

cases:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) After the auxiliaries <i>shall</i>, <i>will</i> (with
<i>should</i> and <i>would</i>).</p>
<p>(2) After the verbs <i>may (might), can (could), must</i>; also

are not to be taken as separate verbs, but with the infinitive as
one tense of a verb; as, "He <i>will choose</i>," "I <i>shall have

<p>Also <i>do</i> may be considered an auxiliary in the
interrogative, negative, and emphatic forms of the present and

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>GERUNDS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>272.</b></span> The gerund is like the
participle in form, and like a noun in use.</p>
<p>The participle has been called an adjectival ver<a name=
"Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>bal; the gerund may be called a
<i>noun verbal</i>. While the gerund expresses action, it has
several attributes of a noun,&mdash;it may be governed as a noun;
it may be the subject of a verb, or the object of a verb or a
preposition; it is often preceded by the definite article; it is
frequently modified by a possessive noun or pronoun.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Distinguished from participle and verbal
noun.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>273.</b></span> It differs from the
participle in being always used as a noun: it never belongs to or
limits a noun.</p>
<p>It differs from the verbal noun in having the property of
governing a noun (which the verbal noun has not) and of expressing
action (the verbal noun merely names an action, Sec. II).</p>
<p>The following are examples of the uses of the gerund:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Subject</i>: "The <i>taking</i> of means not to see
another morning had all day absorbed every energy;" "Certainly
<i>dueling</i> is bad, and has been put down."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Object</i>: (<i>a</i>) "Our culture therefore must not
omit the <i>arming</i> of the man." (<i>b</i>) "Nobody cares for
<i>planting</i> the poor fungus;" "I announce the good of <i>being
interpenetrated</i> by the mind that made nature;" "The guilt of
<i>having been cured</i> of the palsy by a Jewish maiden."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Governing and Governed</i>: "We are far from <i>having
exhausted</i> the significance of the few symbols we use," also (2,
<i>b</i>), above; "He could embellish the characters with new
traits without <i>violating</i> probability;" "He could not help
<i>holding</i> out his hand in return."</p>

<h3>SUMMARY OF WORDS IN <i>-ING</i></h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>274.</b></span> Words in <b>-ing</b> are of
six kinds, according to use as well as meaning. They are as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Part of the verb</i>, making the definite tenses.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Pure participles</i>, which express action, but do not
assert.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Participial adjectives</i>, which express action and also
modify.</p>
<p>(4) <i>Pure adjectives</i>, which have lost all verbal
force.</p>
<p>(5) <i>Gerunds</i>, which express action, may govern and be
governed.</p>
<p>(6) <i>Verbal nouns,</i> which name an action or state, but
cannot govern.</p>

<p>Tell to which of the above six classes each <i>-ing</i> word in
the following sentences belongs:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. Here is need of apologies for shortcomings.</p>
<p>2. Then how pleasing is it, on your leaving the spot, to see the

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_PARSE_VERBS_AND_VERBALS" id=
"HOW_TO_PARSE_VERBS_AND_VERBALS"></a><b>HOW TO PARSE VERBS AND
VERBALS.</b></h2>
<h3>I. VERBS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>275.</b></span> In parsing verbs, give the
following points:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Class: (<i>a</i>) as to <i>form</i>,&mdash;strong or weak,
giving principal parts; (<i>b</i>) as to
<i>use</i>,&mdash;transitive or intransitive.</p>
<p>(2) Voice,&mdash;active or passive.</p>
<p>(3) Mood,&mdash;indicative, subjunctive, or imperative.</p>
<p>(4) Tense,&mdash;which of the tenses given in Sec. 234.</p>
<p>(5) Person and number, in determining which you must
tell&mdash;</p>
<p>(6) What the subject is, for the form of the verb may not show
the person and number.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_180" id=
"Page_180"></a><i>Caution.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>276.</b></span> It has been intimated in
Sec. 235, we must beware of the rule, "A verb agrees with its
subject in person and number." Sometimes it does; usually it does
not, if <i>agrees</i> means that the verb changes its form for the
different persons and numbers. The verb <i>be</i> has more forms
than other verbs, and may be said to <i>agree</i> with its subject
in several of its forms. But unless the verb is present, and ends
in <i>-s</i>, or is an old or poetic form ending in <i>-st</i> or
<i>-eth</i>, it is best for the student not to state it as a
general rule that "the verb agrees with its subject in person and
number," but merely to <i>tell what the subject of the verb
is</i>.</p>
<h3>II. VERB PHRASES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>277.</b></span> Verb phrases are made up of
a principal verb followed by an infinitive, and should always be
analyzed as phrases, and not taken as single verbs. Especially
frequent are those made up of <i>should</i>, <i>would</i>,
<i>may</i>, <i>might</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>could</i>, <i>must</i>,
followed by a pure infinitive without <i>to</i>. Take these
examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Lee <i>should</i> of himself <i>have replenished</i> his
stock.</p>
<p>2. The government <i>might have been</i> strong and
prosperous.</p>
<p>In such sentences as 1, call <i>should</i> a weak verb,
intransitive, therefore active; indicative, past tense; has for its

<h2><a name="ADVERBS" id="ADVERBS"></a><b>ADVERBS.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Adverbs modify.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>279.</b></span> The word <i>adverb</i> means
<i>joined to a verb</i>. The adverb is the only word that can join
to a verb to modify it.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A verb.</i></div>
<p>When <b>action</b> is expressed, an adverb is usually added to
define the action in some way,&mdash;time, place, or manner: as,
"He began <i>already</i> to be proud of being a Rugby boy [time];"
"One of the young heroes scrambled up <i>behind</i> [place];" "He
was absolute, but <i>wisely</i> and <i>bravely</i> ruling
[manner]."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>An adjective or an adverb.</i></div>
<p>But this does not mean that adverbs modify verbs <i>only</i>:
many of them express degree, and limit <b>adjectives</b> or
<b>adverbs</b>; as, "William's private life was <i>severely</i>
pure;" "Principles of English law are put down <i>a little</i>
confusedly."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sometimes a noun or pronoun.</i></div>
<p>Sometimes an adverb may modify <b>a noun or pronoun</b>; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

they are <i>more</i> himself than he is.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>Is it <i>only</i> poets, and men of leisure and cultivation, who
live with nature?&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;These last differ from the words in Sec. 169, being
adverbs naturally and fitly, while those in Sec. 169 are <a name=
"Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>felt to be elliptical, and rather
forced into the service of adjectives.</p>
<p>Also these adverbs modifying nouns are to be distinguished from
those standing <i>after</i> a noun by ellipsis, but really
modifying, not the noun, but some verb understood; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

"smcap">&mdash;Leigh Hunt.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A phrase.</i></div>
<p>An adverb may modify a phrase which is equivalent to an
adjective or an adverb, as shown in the sentences,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

time</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Trollope.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A clause or sentence.</i></div>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>280.</b></span> An <b>adverb</b>, then, is a
modifying word, which may qualify an action word or a statement,
and may add to the meaning of an adjective or adverb, or a word
group used as such.</p>
<p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>NOTE.&mdash;The expression
<i>action word</i> is put instead of <i>verb</i>, because
<i>any</i> verbal word may be limited by an adverb, not simply the
forms used in predication.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>281.</b></span> Adverbs may be classified in
two ways: (1) according to the meaning of the words; (2) according
to their use in the sentence.</p>
<h3>ADVERBS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO MEANING.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>282.</b></span> Thus considered, there are
six classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Time</b>; as <i>now</i>, <i>to-day</i>, <i>ever</i>,
<i>lately</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>hitherto</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Place.</b> These may be adverbs either of</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
<p>(<i>a</i>) PLACE WHERE; as
<i>here</i>,<i>there</i>,<i>where</i>,<i>near</i>,<i>yonder</i>,
<i>above</i>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<i>b</i>) PLACE TO WHICH; as
<i>hither</i>,<i>thither</i>,<i>whither</i>, <i>whithersoever</i>,
etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<i>c</i>) PLACE FROM WHICH; as
<i>hence</i>,<i>thence</i>,<i>whence</i>, <i>whencesoever</i>,
etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) <b>Manner</b>, telling <i>how</i> anything is done; as
<i>well</i>, <i>slowly</i>, <i>better</i>, <i>bravely</i>,
<i>beautifully</i>. Action is conceived or performed in so many
ways, that these adverbs form a very large class.</p>
<p>(4) <b>Number</b>, telling <i>how many times</i>: <i>once</i>,
<i>twice</i>, <i>singly</i>, <i>two by two</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(5) <b>Degree</b>, telling <i>how much</i>; as <i>little</i>,
<i>slightly</i>, <i>too</i>, <i>partly</i>, <i>enough</i>,
<i>greatly</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>very</i>, <i>just</i>, etc. (see
also Sec. 283).</p>
<p>(6) <b>Assertion</b>, telling the speaker's belief or disbelief
in a statement, or how far he believes it to be true; as
<i>perhaps</i>, <i>maybe</i>, <i>surely</i>, <i>possibly</i>,
<i>probably</i>, <i>not</i>, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186"></a><i>Special remarks on adverbs of degree.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>283.</b></span> <b>The</b> is an adverb of
degree when it limits an adjective or an adverb, especially the
comparative of these words; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>But not <i>the</i> less the blare of the tumultuous organ
wrought its own separate creations.<span class="smcap">&mdash;De
Quincey.</span></p>
<p><i>The</i> more they multiply, <i>the</i> more friends you will
have; <i>the</i> more evidently they love liberty, <i>the</i> more
perfect will be their obedience.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Burke.</span></p>
</div>
<p><b>This</b> and <b>that</b> are very common as adverbs in spoken
English, and not infrequently are found in literary English; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The master...was for <i>this</i> once of her opinion.&mdash;R.
LOUIS STEVENSON.</p>
<p>Death! To die! I owe <i>that</i> much To what, at least, I
was.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Browning.</span></p>
<p><i>This</i> long's the text.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></p>
</div>
<p>[Sidenote <i>The status of such</i>.]</p>
<p><b>Such</b> is frequently used as an equivalent of <i>so</i>:
<i>such</i> precedes an adjective with its noun, while <i>so</i>
precedes only the adjective usually.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Meekness,...which gained him <i>such</i> universal
popularity.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Irving.</span></p>
<p><i>Such</i> a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would
have been able to close his eyes there.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>An eye of <i>such</i> piercing brightness and <i>such</i>
commanding power that it gave an air of inspiration.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lecky.</span></p>
</div>
<p>So also in Grote, Emerson, Thackeray, Motley, White, and
others.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Pretty.</i></div>
<p><b>Pretty</b> has a wider adverbial use than it gets credit
for.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I believe our astonishment is <i>pretty</i> equal.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Fielding.</span></p>
<p>Hard blows and hard money, the feel of both of which you know
<i>pretty</i> well by now.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>The first of these generals is <i>pretty</i> generally
recognized as the greatest military genius that ever
lived.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bayne.</span></p>
<p>A <i>pretty</i> large experience.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><i>Pretty</i> is also used
by Prescott, Franklin, De Quincey, Defoe, Dickens, Kingsley, Burke,
Emerson, Aldrich, Holmes, and other writers.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Mighty.</div>
<p>The adverb mighty is very common in colloquial English; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>Mighty</i> well, Deacon Gookin!" replied the solemn tones of
the minister.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
<p>"Maybe you're wanting to get over?&mdash;anybody sick? Ye seem
<i>mighty</i> anxious!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. B.
Stowe</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is only occasionally used in literary English; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>You are <i>mighty</i> courteous.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bulwer.</span></p>
<p>Beau Fielding, a <i>mighty</i> fine gentleman.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>"Peace, Neville," said the king, "thou think'st thyself
<i>mighty</i> wise, and art but a fool."<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
<p>I perceived his sisters <i>mighty</i> busy.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Notice meanings.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>284.</b></span> Again, the meaning of words
must be noticed rather than their form; for many words given above
may be moved from one class to another at will: as these
examples,&mdash;"He walked too <i>far</i> [place];" "That were
<i>far</i> better [degree];" "He spoke <i>positively</i> [manner];"
"That is <i>positively</i> untrue [assertion];" "I have seen you
<i>before</i> [time];" "The house, and its lawn <i>before</i>
[place]."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Simple.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>285.</b></span> All adverbs which have no

<div class="sidenote"><i>Interrogative.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>286.</b></span> Some adverbs, besides

<h3>COMPARISON OF ADVERBS.</h3>

<p><span class="sn"><b>289.</b></span> Most monosyllabic adverbs

superlative, just as adjectives do; as, <i>high</i>, <i>higher</i>,
<i>highest</i>; <i>soon</i>, <i>sooner</i>, <i>soonest</i>.</p>
<p>Adverbs in <i>-ly</i> usually have <i>more</i> and <i>most</i>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Form</i> vs. <i>use.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>290.</b></span> The fact that a word ends in
<i>-ly</i> does not make it an adverb. Many adjectives have the
same ending, and must be distinguished by their use in the
sentence.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Tell what each word in <i>ly</i> modifies, then whether it is an
adjective or an adverb.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>291.</b></span> Again, many words without
<i>-ly</i> have the same form, whether adverbs or adjectives.</p>
<p>The reason is, that in Old and Middle English, adverbs derived
from adjectives had the ending <i>-e</i> as a distinguishing mark;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>In some cases adverbs with <i>-ly</i> are used side by side with
those without <i>-ly</i>, but with a different meaning. Such are
<i>most</i>, <i>mostly</i>; <i>near</i>, <i>nearly</i>;
<i>even</i>, <i>evenly</i>; <i>hard</i>, <i>hardly</i>; etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Special use of</i> there.</div>

<h3>HOW TO PARSE ADVERBS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>293.</b></span> <b>In parsing</b> adverbs,
give&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The class, according to meaning and also use.</p>
<p>(2) Degree of comparison, if the word is compared.</p>
<p>(3) What word or word group it modifies.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Parse all the adverbs in the following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. Now the earth is so full that a drop overfills it.</p>

<h2><a name="CONJUNCTIONS" id=
"CONJUNCTIONS"></a><b>CONJUNCTIONS.</b></h2>
<p><span class="sn"><b>294.</b></span> Unlike adverbs, conjunctions
do not modify: they are used solely for the purpose of
connecting.</p>
<p>Examples of the use of conjunctions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>They connect</i> words.</div>
<p>(1) <i>Connecting words</i>: "It is the very necessity
<i>and</i> condition of existence;" "What a simple <i>but</i>
exquisite illustration!"</p>
<div class="sidenote">Word groups: <i>Phrases.</i></div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Clauses.</i></div>
<p>(2) <i>Connecting word groups</i>: "Hitherto the two systems
have existed in different States, <i>but</i> side by side within
the American Union;" "This has happened <i>because</i> the Union is
a confederation of States."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sentences.</i></div>
<p>(3) <i>Connecting sentences</i>: "Unanimity in this case can
mean only a very large majority. <i>But</i> even unanimity itself
is far from indicating the voice of God."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Paragraphs.</i></div>
<p>(4) <i>Connecting sentence groups</i>: Paragraphs would be too
long to quote here, but the student will readily find them, in
which the writer connects the divisions of narration or argument by
such words as <i>but</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>nor</i>,
<i>then</i>, <i>therefore</i>, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>295.</b></span> A <b>conjunction</b> is a
linking word, connecting words, word groups, sentences, or sentence
groups.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Classes of conjunctions.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>296.</b></span> Conjunctions have two
principal divisions:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Co&ouml;rdinate</b>, joining words, word groups, etc., of
the <i>same rank</i>.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Subordinate</b>, joining a subordinate or dependent
clause to a principal or independent clause.<a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194"></a></p>
<h3>CO&Ouml;RDINATE CONJUNCTIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>297.</b></span> Co&ouml;rdinate conjunctions
are of four kinds:</p>
<p>(1) COPULATIVE, coupling or uniting words and expressions in the
same line of thought; as <i>and</i>, <i>also</i>, <i>as well
as</i>, <i>moreover</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(2) ADVERSATIVE, connecting words and expressions that are
opposite in thought; as <i>but</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>still</i>,
<i>however</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>only</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(3) CAUSAL, introducing a reason or cause. The chief ones are,
<i>for</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>hence</i>, <i>then</i>.</p>
<p>(4) ALTERNATIVE, expressing a choice, usually between two
things. They are <i>or</i>, <i>either</i>, <i>else</i>, <i>nor</i>,
<i>neither</i>, <i>whether</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Correlatives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>298.</b></span> Some of these go in pairs,
answering to each other in the same sentence; as,
<i>both</i>...<i>and</i>; <i>not only</i>...<i>but</i> (or <i>but
also</i>); <i>either</i>...<i>or</i>; <i>whether</i>...<i>or</i>;
<i>neither</i>...<i>nor</i>; <i>whether</i>...<i>or
whether</i>.</p>
<p>Some go in threes; as, <i>not only</i>...<i>but</i>...
<i>and</i>; <i>either</i>...<i>or</i>...<i>or</i>;
<i>neither</i>...<i>nor</i>... <i>nor</i>.</p>
<p>Further examples of the use of co&ouml;rdinate
conjunctions:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Copulative.</i></div>
<p>Your letter, <i>likewise</i>, had its weight; the bread was

<p>The assertion, <i>however</i>, serves but to show their
ignorance. "Can this be so?" said Goodman Brown. "<i>Howbeit</i>, I

</div>
<h3>SUBORDINATE CONJUNCTIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>299.</b></span> Subordinate conjunctions are
of the following kinds:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) PLACE: <i>where</i>, <i>wherever</i>, <i>whither</i>,
<i>whereto</i>, <i>whithersoever</i>, <i>whence</i>, etc.</p>
<p>(2) TIME: <i>when</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>after</i>,

<h3>SPECIAL REMARKS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote">As if.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>301.</b></span> <i>As if</i> is often used
as one conjunction of manner, but really there is an ellipsis
between the two words; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i8">But thy soft
murmuring<br /></span> <span>Sounds sweet <i>as if</i> a sister's
voice reproved.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Byron.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>If analyzed, the expression would be, "sounds sweet <i>as</i>
[the sound would be] <i>if</i> a sister's voice reproved;"
<i>as</i>, in this case, expressing degree if taken separately.</p>
<p>But the ellipsis seems to be lost sight of fre<a name="Page_199"
id="Page_199"></a>quently in writing, as is shown by the use of
<i>as though</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote">As though.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>302.</b></span> In Emerson's sentence, "We
meet, and part <i>as though</i> we parted not," it cannot be said
that there is an ellipsis: it cannot mean "we part <i>as</i> [we
should part] <i>though</i>" etc.</p>
<p>Consequently, <i>as if</i> and <i>as though</i> may be taken as
double conjunctions expressing manner. <i>As though</i> seems to be
in as wide use as the conjunction <i>as if</i>; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>HOW TO PARSE CONJUNCTIONS</b>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>304.</b></span> In parsing conjunctions,
tell&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) To what class and subclass they belong.</p>
<p>(2) What words, word groups, etc., they connect.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution</i>.</div>
<p>In classifying them, particular attention must <a name=
"Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>be paid to the <i>meaning</i> of the
word. Some conjunctions, such as <i>nor, and, because, when</i>,
etc., are regularly of one particular class; others belong to
several classes. For example, compare the sentences,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. It continued raining, <i>so</i> that I could not stir
abroad.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Defoe</span></p>
<p>2. There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions,
<i>so</i> they be each honest and natural in their
hour.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson</span></p>
<p>3. It was too dark to put an arrow into the creature's eye;
<i>so</i> they paddled on.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley</span></p>
</div>
<p>In sentence 1, <i>so that</i> expresses result, and its clause
depends on the other, hence it is a subordinate conjunction of
result; in 2, <i>so</i> means provided,&mdash;is subordinate of
condition; in 3, <i>so</i> means therefore, and its clause is
independent, hence it is a co&ouml;rdinate conjunction of
reason.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>

<p>16. Now you have the whip in your hand, won't you lay on?</p>
<p>17. I scowl as I dip my pen into the inkstand.</p>
<p>18. I speak, therefore, of good novels only.</p>
<p>19. Let her loose in the library as you do a fawn in a

<p>25. He follows his genius whithersoever it may lead him.</p>
<p>26. The manuscript indeed speaks of many more, whose names I

<h2><a name="PREPOSITIONS" id=
"PREPOSITIONS"></a><b>PREPOSITIONS.</b>.</h2>
<p><span class="sn"><b>305.</b></span> The word <i>preposition</i>
implies <i>place before</i>: hence it would seem that a preposition
is always <i>before</i> its object. It may be so in the majority of
cases, but in a considerable proportion of instances the
preposition is <i>after</i> its object.</p>
<p>This occurs in such cases as the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Preposition not before its object.</div>
<p>(1) <i>After a relative pronoun</i>, a very common occurrence;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The most dismal Christmas fun <i>which</i> these eyes ever
looked <i>on</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<i>of</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>A foe, <i>whom</i> a champion has fought <i>with</i>
to-day.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It's the man <i>that</i> I spoke to you <i>about</i>" said Mr.
Pickwick.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dickens.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(2) <i>After an interrogative adverb, adjective, or pronoun</i>,
also frequently found:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>What</i> God doth the wizard pray <i>to</i>?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>What</i> is the little one thinking about?&mdash;<span class=

</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Where</i> the Devil did it come <i>from</i>, I
wonder?<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dickens.</span></p>
</div>
<p>(3) <i>With an infinitive</i>, in such expressions as
these:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>A proper <i>quarrel</i> for a Crusader to do battle
<i>in</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>

<p>Places for <i>horses</i> to be hitched
<i>to</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>(4) <i>After a noun</i>,&mdash;the case in which the preposition
is expected to be, and regularly is, before its object;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And unseen mermaids' pearly

"smcap">&mdash;Keats.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>306.</b></span> Since the object of a
preposition is most often a noun, the statement is made that the
preposition usually precedes its object; as in the following
sentence, "Roused <i>by</i> the shock, he started <i>from</i> his
trance."</p>
<p>Here the words <i>by</i> and <i>from</i> are connectives; but
they do more than connect. <i>By</i> shows the relation in thought
between <i>roused</i> and <i>shock</i>, expressing means or agency;
<i>from</i> shows the relation in thought between <i>started</i>
and <i>trance</i>, and expresses separation. Both introduce
phrases.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>307.</b></span> A <b>preposition</b> is a
word joined to a noun or its equivalent to make up a qualifying or
an adverbial phrase, and to show the relation between its object
and the word modified.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Objects, nouns and the
following</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>308.</b></span> Besides nouns, prepositions
may have as objects&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Pronouns</i>: "Upon <i>them</i> with the lance;" "With
<i>whom</i> I traverse earth."</p>
<p><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>(2) <i>Adjectives</i>: "On

<p>(4) <i>Phrases</i>: "Everything came to her from <i>on

<p>(5) <i>Infinitives</i>: "The queen now scarce spoke to him save
<i>to convey</i> some necessary command for her service."</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Object usually objective case, if noun or
pronoun</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>309.</b></span> The object of a preposition,
if a noun or pronoun, is usually in the objective case. In
pronouns, this is shown by the form of the word, as in Sec. 308
(1).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Often possessive</i>.</div>
<p>In the double-possessive idiom, however, the object is in the
possessive case after <i>of</i>; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>There was also a book <i>of Defoe's</i>,... and another
<i>of</i> <i>Mather's</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Franklin.</span></p>
</div>
<p>See also numerous examples in Secs. 68 and 87.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sometimes nominative</i>.</div>
<p>And the prepositions <i>but</i> and <i>save</i> are found with
the nominative form of the pronoun following; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

<h3><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>USES OF PREPOSITIONS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Inseparable.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>310.</b></span> Prepositions are used in
three ways:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Compounded with verbs</i>, <i>adverbs</i>, or
<i>conjunctions</i>; as, for example, with verbs, <i>with</i>draw,
<i>under</i>stand, <i>over</i>look, <i>over</i>take,
<i>over</i>flow, <i>under</i>go, <i>out</i>stay, <i>out</i>number,
<i>over</i>run, <i>over</i>grow, etc.; with adverbs,
there<i>at</i>, there<i>in</i>, there<i>from</i>, there<i>by</i>,
there<i>with</i>, etc.; with conjunctions, where<i>at</i>,
where<i>in</i>, where<i>on</i>, where<i>through</i>,
where<i>upon</i>, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Separable.</i></div>
<p>(2) <i>Following a verb</i>, and being really a part of the
verb. This use needs to be watched closely, to see whether the
preposition belongs to the verb or has a separate prepositional
function. For example, in the sentences, (<i>a</i>) "He broke a
pane <i>from</i> the window," (<i>b</i>) "He broke <i>into</i> the
bank," in (<i>a</i>), the verb <i>broke</i> is a predicate,
modified by the phrase introduced by <i>from</i>; in (<i>b</i>),
the predicate is not <i>broke</i>, modified by <i>into the
bank</i>, but <i>broke into</i>&mdash;the object, <i>bank</i>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_206" id=
"Page_206"></a><i>Ordinary use as connective, relation
words.</i></div>
<p>(3) As <i>relation words</i>, introducing phrases,&mdash;the
most common use, in which the words have their own proper
function.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Usefulness of prepositions.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>311.</b></span> Prepositions are the
subtlest and most useful words in the language for compressing a
clear meaning into few words. Each preposition has its proper and
general meaning, which, by frequent and exacting use, has expanded
and divided into a variety of meanings more or less close to the
original one.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the word <i>over</i>. It expresses place,
with motion, as, "The bird flew <i>over</i> the house;" or rest,
as, "Silence broods <i>over</i> the earth." It may also convey the
meaning of <i>about</i>, <i>concerning</i>; as, "They quarreled
<i>over</i> the booty." Or it may express time: "Stay <i>over</i>
night."</p>
<p>The language is made richer and more flexible by there being
several meanings to each of many prepositions, as well as by some
of them having the same meaning as others.</p>
<h3>CLASSES OF PREPOSITIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>312.</b></span> It would be useless to
attempt to classify all the prepositions, since they are so various
in meaning.</p>
<p>The largest groups are those of <b>place</b>, <b>time</b>, and
<b>exclusion</b>.</p>
<h3>PREPOSITIONS OF PLACE.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>313.</b></span> The following are the most
common to indicate <b>place</b>:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) PLACE WHERE: <i>abaft</i>, <i>about</i>, <i>above</i>,
<i>across</i>, <i>amid</i> (<i>amidst</i>), <i>among</i>
(<i>amongst</i>), <i>at</i>, <i>athwart</i>, <i>be<a name=
"Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>low</i>, <i>beneath</i>,
<i>beside</i>, <i>between</i> (<i>betwixt</i>), <i>beyond</i>,
<i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>over</i>, <i>under</i>
(<i>underneath</i>), <i>upon</i>, <i>round</i> or <i>around</i>,
<i>without</i>.</p>
<p>(2) PLACE WHITHER: <i>into</i>, <i>unto</i>, <i>up</i>,
<i>through</i>, <i>throughout</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>towards</i>.</p>
<p>(3) PLACE WHENCE: <i>down</i>, <i>from</i> (<i>away from</i>,
<i>down from</i>, <i>from out</i>, etc.), <i>off</i>, <i>out
of</i>.</p>
<p><b>Abaft</b> is exclusively a sea term, meaning <i>back
of</i>.</p>
<p><b>Among</b> (or <b>amongst</b>) and <b>between</b> (or
<b>betwixt</b>) have a difference in meaning, and usually a
difference in use. <i>Among</i> originally meant in the crowd
(<i>on gemong</i>), referring to several objects; <i>between</i>
and <i>betwixt</i> were originally made up of the preposition
<i>be</i> (meaning <i>by</i>) and <i>tw&#275;on</i> or
<i>tw&#275;onum</i> (modern <i>twain</i>), <i>by two</i>, and
<i>be</i> with <i>tw&#299;h</i> (or <i>twuh</i>), having the same
meaning, <i>by two</i> objects.</p>
<p>As to modern use, see "Syntax" (Sec. 459).</p>
<h3>PREPOSITIONS OF TIME.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>314.</b></span> They are <i>after</i>,
<i>during</i>, <i>pending</i>, <i>till</i> or <i>until</i>; also
many of the prepositions of place express <b>time</b> when put
before words indicating time, such as <i>at</i>, <i>between</i>,
<i>by</i>, <i>about</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>within</i>, etc.</p>
<p>These are all familiar, and need no special remark.</p>
<h3>EXCLUSION OR SEPARATION.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>315.</b></span> The chief ones are
<i>besides</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>except</i>, <i>save</i>,
<i>without</i>. The participle <i>excepting</i> is also used as a
preposition.</p>
<h3>MISCELLANEOUS PREPOSITIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>316.</b></span> <b>Against</b> implies
opposition, sometimes place where. In colloquial English it is
sometimes <a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>used to express
time, now and then also in literary English; for
example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>She contrived to fit up the baby's cradle for me <i>against</i>
night.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Swift</span></p>
</div>
<p><b>About</b>, and the participial prepositions
<b>concerning</b>, <b>respecting</b>, <b>regarding,</b> mean
<i>with reference to</i>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Phrase prepositions.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>317.</b></span> Many phrases are used as
single prepositions: <i>by means of</i>, <i>by virtue of</i>, <i>by
help of</i>, <i>by dint of</i>, <i>by force of</i>; <i>out of</i>,
<i>on account of</i>, <i>by way of</i>, <i>for the sake of</i>;
<i>in consideration of</i>, <i>in spite of</i>, <i>in defiance
of</i>, <i>instead of</i>, <i>in view of</i>, <i>in place of</i>;
<i>with respect to</i>, <i>with regard to</i>, <i>according to</i>,
<i>agreeably to</i>; and some others.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>318.</b></span> Besides all these, there are
some prepositions that have so many meanings that they require
separate and careful treatment: <i>on</i> (<i>upon</i>), <i>at</i>,
<i>by</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>,
<i>with</i>.</p>
<p>No attempt will be made to give <i>all</i> the meanings that
each one in this list has: the purpose is to stimulate observation,
and to show how useful prepositions really are.</p>
<h3>At.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>319.</b></span> The general meaning of
<b>at</b> is <i>near</i>, <i>close to</i>, after a verb or
expression implying position; and <i>towards</i> after a verb or
expression indicating motion. It defines position approximately,
while <i>in</i> is exact, meaning <i>within</i>.</p>
<p>Its principal uses are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Place where.</i></p>

<h3>HOW TO PARSE PREPOSITIONS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>327.</b></span> Since a preposition
introduces a phrase and shows the relation between two things, it
is necessary, first of all, to find the object of the preposition,
and then to find what word the prepositional phrase limits. Take
this sentence:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The rule adopted on board the ships on which I have met "the man
without a country" was, I think, transmitted from the
beginning.&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. E. Hale</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The phrases are (1) <i>on board the ships</i>, (2) <i>on
which</i>, (3) <i>without a country</i>, (4) <i>from the
beginning</i>. The object of <i>on board</i> is <i>ships</i>; of
<i>on</i>, <i>which</i>; of <i>without</i>, <i>country</i>; of
<i>from</i>, <i>beginning</i>.</p>
<p>In (1), the phrase answers the question <i>where</i>, and has
the office of an adverb in telling <i>where</i> <a name="Page_220"
id="Page_220"></a>the rule is adopted; hence we say, <i>on
board</i> shows the relation between <i>ships</i> and the
participle <i>adopted</i>.</p>
<p>In (2), <i>on which</i> modifies the verb <i>have met</i> by
telling where: hence <i>on</i> shows the relation between
<i>which</i> (standing for <i>ships</i>) and the verb <i>have
met</i>.</p>
<p>In (3), <i>without a country</i> modifies <i>man</i>, telling
what man, or the verb <i>was</i> understood: hence <i>without</i>
shows the relation between <i>country</i> and <i>man</i>, or
<i>was</i>. And so on.</p>
<p>The <b>parsing</b> of prepositions means merely telling between
what words or word groups they show relation.</p>

<p>1. I remember, before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us
one day into those gardens. I must needs show my wit by a silly
illusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their
language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious rogue,
watching his opportunity when I was walking under one of them,
shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of
them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my
ears; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and
knocked me down flat on my face; but I received no other hurt, and

several times, but all to no purpose. I looked towards my windows,
and could see nothing but the clouds and the sky. I heard a noise
just over my head, like the clapping of wings, and then began to
perceive the woeful condition I <a name="Page_221" id=

exclamations used to express emotion, and are not parts of speech

<div class="sidenote"><i>What analysis is.</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>335.</b></span> All discourse is made up of
sentences: consequently the sentence is the unit with which we must
begin. And in order to get a clear and practical idea of the
structure of sentences, it is necessary to become expert in
<b>analysis</b>; that is, in separating them into their component
parts.</p>
<p>A general idea of analysis was needed in our study of the parts
of speech,&mdash;in determining case, subject and predicate,
clauses introduced by conjunctions, etc.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Value of analysis.</i></div>
<p>A more thorough and accurate acquaintance with the subject is
necessary for two reasons,&mdash;not only for a correct
understanding of the principles of syntax, but for the study of
punctuation and other topics treated in rhetoric.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>336.</b></span> A <b>sentence</b> is the
expression of a thought in words.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Kinds of sentences as to form.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>337.</b></span> According to the way in
which a thought is put before a listener or reader, sentences may
be of three kinds:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <b>Declarative</b>, which puts the thought in the form of a
declaration or assertion. This is the most common one.</p>
<p>(2) <b>Interrogative</b>, which puts the thought in a
question.</p>
<p>(3) <b>Imperative</b>, which expresses command, entreaty, or
request.</p>
<p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>Any one of these may be put
in the form of an exclamation, but the sentence would still be
declarative, interrogative, or imperative; hence, <i>according to
form</i>, there are only the three kinds of sentences already
named.</p>
<p>Examples of these three kinds are, declarative, "Old year, you
must not die!" interrogative, "Hath he not always treasures, always
friends?" imperative, "Come to the bridal chamber, Death!"</p>

<h2><a name="SIMPLE_SENTENCES" id="SIMPLE_SENTENCES"></a><b>SIMPLE
SENTENCES.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Division according to number of
statements.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>338.</b></span> But the division of
sentences most necessary to analysis is the division, not according
to the form in which a thought is put, but according to how many
statements there are.</p>
<p>The one we shall consider first is the <b>simple
sentence.</b></p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>339.</b></span> A <b>simple sentence</b> is
one which contains a single statement, question, or command: for
example, "The quality of mercy is not strained;" "What wouldst thou
do, old man?" "Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>340.</b></span> Every sentence must contain
two parts,&mdash;a <b>subject</b> and a <b>predicate</b>.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition: Predicate.</i></div>
<p>The <b>predicate</b> of a sentence is a verb or verb phrase
which says something about the subject.</p>
<p><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>In order to get a correct
definition of the subject, let us examine two specimen
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. But now all is to be changed.</p>
<p>2. A rare old plant is the ivy green.</p>
</div>
<p>In the first sentence we find the subject by placing the word
<i>what</i> before the predicate,&mdash;<i>What</i> is to be
changed? Answer, <i>all</i>. Consequently, we say <i>all</i> is the
subject of the sentence.</p>
<p>But if we try this with the second sentence, we have some
trouble,&mdash;<i>What</i> is the ivy green? Answer, <i>a rare old
plant</i>. But we cannot help seeing that an assertion is made, not
of <i>a rare old plant</i>, but about <i>the ivy green</i>; and the
real subject is the latter. Sentences are frequently in this
inverted order, especially in poetry; and our definition must be
the following, to suit all cases:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Subject.</i></div>
<p>The <b>subject</b> is that which answers the question <i>who</i>
or <i>what</i> placed before the predicate, and which at the same
time names that of which the predicate says something.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The subject in interrogative and
imperative simple sentences.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>341.</b></span> In the interrogative
sentence, the subject is frequently after the verb. Either the verb
is the first word of the sentence, or an interrogative pronoun,
adjective, or adverb that asks about the subject. In analyzing such
sentences, <i>always reduce them to the order of a statement</i>.
Thus,&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) "When should this scientific education be commenced?"</p>
<p>(2) "This scientific education should be commenced when?"</p>
<p>(3) "What wouldst thou have a good great man obtain?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>(4) "Thou wouldst have a
good great man obtain what?"</p>
<p>In the imperative sentence, the subject (<i>you</i>,
<i>thou</i>, or <i>ye</i>) is in most cases omitted, and is to be
supplied; as, "[You] behold her single in the field."</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Name the subject and the predicate in each of the following
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The shadow of the dome of
pleasure<br /></span> <span>Floated midway on the

<p>9. Such was not the effect produced on the sanguine spirit of

</div>
<h3>ELEMENTS OF THE SIMPLE SENTENCE.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>342.</b></span> All the <b>elements</b> of
the simple sentence are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The subject.</p>
<p>(2) The predicate.</p>
<p>(3) The object.</p>
<p>(4) The complements.</p>
<p>(5) Modifiers.</p>
<p>(6) Independent elements.</p>
<p>The subject and predicate have been discussed.</p>
<p><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class=
"sn"><b>343.</b></span> The object may be of two kinds:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definitions. Direct Object</i>.</div>
<p>(1) The DIRECT OBJECT is that word or expression which answers
the question <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> placed after the verb; or
the direct object names that toward which the action of the
predicate is directed.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that any verbal may have an object; but
for the present we speak of the object of the verb, and by
<i>object</i> we mean the <i>direct</i> object.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Indirect object</i>.</div>
<p>(2) The INDIRECT OBJECT is a noun or its equivalent used as the
modifier of a verb or verbal to name the person or thing for whose
benefit an action is performed.</p>
<p>Examples of direct and indirect objects are, direct, "She seldom
saw her <i>course</i> at a glance;" indirect, "I give <i>thee</i>
this to wear at the collar."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Complement</i>:</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>344.</b></span> A <b>complement</b> is a
word added to a verb of incomplete predication to complete its
meaning.</p>
<p>Notice that a verb of incomplete predication may be of two
kinds,&mdash;transitive and intransitive.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Of a transitive verb</i>.</div>
<p>The <i>transitive verb</i> often requires, in addition to the
object, a word to define fully the action that is exerted upon the
object; for example, "Ye call me chief." Here the verb <i>call</i>
has an object <i>me</i> (if we leave out <i>chief</i>), and means
summoned; but <i>chief</i> belongs to the verb, and <i>me</i> here
is not the object simply of <i>call</i>, but of <i>call chief</i>,
just as if to say, "Ye <i>honor me</i>." This word completing a
transitive verb is sometimes called a <i>factitive object</i>, or
<i>second object</i>, but it is a true complement.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a complement can be more <a name=
"Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>clearly seen when the verb is in the
passive. See sentence 19, in exercise following Sec. 364.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Complement of an intransitive
verb</i>.</div>
<p>An <i>intransitive verb</i>, especially the forms of <i>be</i>,
<i>seem</i>, <i>appear</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>feel</i>,
<i>become</i>, etc., must often have a word to complete the
meaning: as, for instance, "Brow and head were <i>round, and of
massive weight</i>;" "The good man, he was now getting <i>old</i>,
above sixty;" "Nothing could be <i>more copious</i> than his talk;"
"But in general he seemed <i>deficient in laughter</i>."</p>
<p>All these complete intransitive verbs. The following are
examples of complements of transitive verbs: "Hope deferred maketh
the heart <i>sick</i>;" "He was termed <i>Thomas</i>, or, more
familiarly, <i>Thom of the Gills</i>;" "A plentiful fortune is
reckoned <i>necessary</i>, in the popular judgment, to the
completion of this man of the world."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>345.</b></span> The <b>modifiers</b> and
<b>independent elements</b> will be discussed in detail in Secs.
351, 352, 355.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Phrases</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>346.</b></span> A phrase is a group of
words, not containing a verb, but used as a single modifier.</p>
<p>As to <i>form</i>, phrases are of three kinds:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Three kinds</i>.</div>
<p>(1) PREPOSITIONAL, introduced by a preposition: for example,
"Such a convulsion is the struggle <i>of gradual suffocation</i>,
as <i>in drowning</i>; and, <i>in the original Opium
Confessions</i>, I mentioned a case <i>of that nature</i>."</p>
<p>(2) PARTICIPIAL, consisting of a participle and the words
dependent on it. The following are examples: "Then <i>retreating
into the warm house</i>, and <i>barring the door</i>, she sat down
to undress the two youngest children."</p>
<p><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>(3) INFINITIVE, consisting
of an infinitive and the words dependent upon it; as in the
sentence, "She left her home forever in order <i>to present herself
at the Dauphin's court</i>."</p>
<h3>Things used as Subject.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>347.</b></span> The subject of a simple
sentence may be&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Noun</i>: "There seems to be no <i>interval</i> between
greatness and meanness." Also an expression used as a noun; as, "A
cheery, '<i>Ay, ay, sir</i>!' rang out in response."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Pronoun</i>: "We are fortified by every heroic
anecdote."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Infinitive phrase</i>: "<i>To enumerate and analyze these
relations</i> is to teach the science of method."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Gerund</i>: "There will be <i>sleeping</i> enough in the
grave;" "What signifies <i>wishing</i> and <i>hoping</i> for better
things?"</p>
<p>(5) <i>Adjective used as noun</i>: "<i>The good</i> are
befriended even by weakness and defect;" "<i>The dead</i> are
there."</p>
<p>(6) <i>Adverb</i>: "<i>Then</i> is the moment for the humming
bird to secure the insects."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>348.</b></span> The subject is often found
<i>after the verb</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>By simple inversion</i>: as, "Therein has been, and ever
will be, my <i>deficiency</i>,&mdash;the talent of starting the
game;" "Never, from their lips, was heard one <i>syllable</i> to
justify," etc.</p>
<p>(2) <i>In interrogative sentences</i>, for which see Sec.
341.</p>
<p><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>(3) <i>After</i> "it
<i>introductory</i>:" "It ought not to need <i>to print</i> in a
reading room a caution not to read aloud."</p>
<p>In this sentence, <i>it</i> stands in the position of a
grammatical subject; but the real or logical subject is <i>to
print</i>, etc. <i>It</i> merely serves to throw the subject after
a verb.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Disguised infinitive subject</i>.</div>
<p>There is one kind of expression that is really an infinitive,
though disguised as a prepositional phrase: "It is hard <i>for
honest men to separate</i> their country from their party, or their
religion from their sect."</p>
<p>The <i>for</i> did not belong there originally, but obscures the
real subject,&mdash;the infinitive phrase. Compare Chaucer: "No
wonder is a lewed man to ruste" (No wonder [it] is [for] a common
man to rust).</p>
<p>(4) <i>After</i> "there <i>introductory</i>," which has the same
office as <i>it</i> in reversing the order (see Sec. 292): "There
was a <i>description</i> of the destructive operations of time;"
"There are <i>asking eyes</i>, <i>asserting eyes</i>, <i>prowling
eyes</i>."</p>
<h3>Things used as Direct Object.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>349.</b></span> The words used as direct
object are mainly the same as those used for subject, but they will
be given in detail here, for the sake of presenting
examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Noun</i>: "Each man has his own <i>vocation</i>." Also
expressions used as nouns: for example, "'<i>By God, and by Saint
George!</i>' said the King."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Pronoun</i>: "Memory greets <i>them</i> with the ghost of
a smile."</p>
<p><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>(3) <i>Infinitive</i>: "We
like <i>to see</i> everything do its office."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Gerund</i>: "She heard that <i>sobbing</i> of litanies,
or the <i>thundering</i> of organs."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Adjective used as a noun</i>: "For seventy leagues
through the mighty cathedral, I saw <i>the quick</i> and <i>the
dead</i>."</p>
<h3>Things used as Complement.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Complement: Of an intransitive
verb</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>350.</b></span> As complement of an
<i>intransitive</i> verb,&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Noun</i>: "She had been an ardent <i>patriot</i>."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Pronoun</i>: "<i>Who</i> is she in bloody coronation
robes from Rheims?" "This is <i>she</i>, the shepherd girl."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Adjective</i>: "Innocence is ever <i>simple</i> and
<i>credulous</i>."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Infinitive</i>: "To enumerate and analyze these relations
is <i>to teach</i> the science of method."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Gerund</i>: "Life is a <i>pitching</i> of this
penny,&mdash;heads or tails;" "Serving others is <i>serving</i>
us."</p>
<p>(6) <i>A prepositional phrase</i>: "His frame is <i>on a larger
scale</i>;" "The marks were <i>of a kind</i> not to be
mistaken."</p>
<p>It will be noticed that all these complements have a double
office,&mdash;completing the predicate, and explaining or modifying
the subject.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Of a transitive verb</i>.</div>
<p>As complement of a <i>transitive</i> verb,&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Noun</i>: "I will not call you <i>cowards</i>."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Adjective</i>: "Manners make beauty <i>superfluous</i>
and <i>ugly</i>;" "Their tempers, doubtless, are rendered
<i>pliant</i> and <i>malleable</i> in the fiery furnace of domestic
tribulation." In this last sentence, the object is made the subject
by being passive, and <a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>the
words italicized are still complements. Like all the complements in
this list, they are adjuncts of the object, and, at the same time,
complements of the predicate.</p>
<p>(3) <i>Infinitive</i>, or <i>infinitive phrase</i>: "That cry
which made me <i>look a thousand ways</i>;" "I hear the echoes
<i>throng</i>."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Participle</i>, or <i>participial phrase</i>: "I can
imagine him <i>pushing firmly on, trusting the hearts of his
countrymen</i>."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Prepositional phrase:</i> "My antagonist would render my
poniard and my speed <i>of no use</i> to me."</p>
<h3>Modifiers.</h3>
<h3>I. Modifiers of Subject, Object, or Complement.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>351.</b></span> Since the subject and object
are either nouns or some equivalent of a noun, the words modifying
them must be adjectives or some equivalent of an adjective; and
whenever the complement is a noun, or the equivalent of the noun,
it is modified by the same words and word groups that modify the
subject and the object.</p>
<p>These <b>modifiers</b> are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>A possessive</i>: "<i>My</i> memory assures me of this;"
"She asked her <i>father's</i> permission."</p>
<p>(2) <i>A word in apposition</i>: "Theodore Wieland, the
<i>prisoner</i> at the bar, was now called upon for his defense;"
"Him, this young <i>idolater</i>, I have seasoned for thee."</p>
<p>(3) <i>An adjective</i>: "<i>Great</i> geniuses have the
<i>shortest</i> biographies;" "Her father was a prince in
Lebanon,&mdash;<i>proud</i>, <i>unforgiving</i>,
<i>austere</i>."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Prepositional phrase</i>: "Are the opinions <i>of
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>a man on right and wrong on
fate and causation</i>, at the mercy of a broken sleep or an
indigestion?" "The poet needs a ground <i>in popular tradition</i>
to work on."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Infinitive phrase</i>: "The way <i>to know him</i> is to
compare him, not with nature, but with other men;" "She has a new
and unattempted problem <i>to solve</i>;" "The simplest utterances
are worthiest <i>to be written</i>."</p>
<p>(6) <i>Participial phrase</i>: "Another reading, <i>given at the
request of a Dutch lady</i>, was the scene from King John;" "This
was the hour <i>already appointed for the baptism</i> of the new
Christian daughter."</p>
<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;In each sentence in Sec. 351, tell
whether the subject, object, or complement is modified.</p>
<h3>II. Modifiers of the Predicate.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>352.</b></span> Since the predicate is
always a verb, the word modifying it must be an adverb or its
equivalent:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Adverb:</i> "<i>Slowly</i> and <i>sadly</i> we laid him
down."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Prepositional phrase</i>: "The little carriage is
creeping on <i>at one mile an hour</i>;" "<i>In the twinkling of an
eye</i>, our horses had carried us <i>to the termination of the
umbrageous isle</i>."</p>
<p>In such a sentence as, "He died like a God," the word group
<i>like a God</i> is often taken as a phrase; but it is really a
contracted clause, the verb being omitted.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Tells how.</i></div>
<p>(3) <i>Participial phrase:</i> "She comes down from heaven to
his help, <i>interpreting for him the most difficult truths</i>,
and <i>leading him from star to star</i>."</p>
<p><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>(4) <i>Infinitive
phrase:</i> "No imprudent, no sociable angel, ever dropped an early
syllable <i>to answer his longing</i>."</p>
<p>(For participial and infinitive phrases, see further Secs.
357-363.)</p>
<p>(5) <i>Indirect object:</i> "I gave <i>every man</i> a trumpet;"
"Give <i>them</i> not only noble teachings, but noble
teachers."</p>
<p>These are equivalent to the phrases <i>to every man</i> and
<i>to them</i>, and modify the predicate in the same way.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Retained with passive; or</i></div>
<p>When the verb is changed from active to passive, the indirect
object is retained, as in these sentences: "It is left <i>you</i>
to find out the reason why;" "All such knowledge should be given
<i>her</i>."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>subject of passive verb and direct object
retained.</i></div>
<p>Or sometimes the indirect object of the active voice becomes the
subject of the passive, and the direct object is retained: for
example, "She is to be taught <i>to extend the limits of her
sympathy</i>;" "I was shown an immense <i>sarcophagus</i>."</p>
<p>(6) <i>Adverbial objective.</i> These answer the question
<i>when</i>, or <i>how long</i>, <i>how far</i>, etc., and are
consequently equivalent to adverbs in modifying a predicate: "We
were now running <i>thirteen miles an hour</i>;" "<i>One way</i>
lies hope;" "<i>Four hours</i> before midnight we approached a
mighty minster."</p>

<h3>Compound Subject, Compound Predicate, etc.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Not compound sentences.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>353.</b></span> Frequently in a simple
sentence the writer uses two or more predicates to the same
subject, two or more subjects of the same predicate, several
modifiers, complements, etc.; but it is to be noticed that, in all
such sentences as we quote below, the writers of them purposely
combined them <i>in single statements</i>, and they are not to be
expanded into compound sentences. In a compound sentence the object
is to make two or more full statements.</p>
<p>Examples of compound subjects are, "By degrees Rip's <i>awe</i>
and <i>apprehension</i> subsided;" "The <i>name of the child</i>,
<i>the air of the mother</i>, the <i>tone of her
voice</i>,&mdash;all awakened a train of recollections in his
mind."</p>
<p>Sentences with compound predicates are, "The company <i>broke
up</i>, and <i>returned</i> to the more important concerns of the
election;" "He <i>shook</i> his head, <i>shouldered</i> the rusty
firelock, and, with a <a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>heart
full of trouble and anxiety, <i>turned</i> his steps homeward."</p>
<p>Sentences with compound objects of the same verb are, "He caught
his <i>daughter</i> and her <i>child</i> in his arms;"
"<i>Voyages</i> and <i>travels</i> I would also have."</p>
<p>And so with complements, modifiers, etc.</p>
<h3>Logical Subject and Logical Predicate.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>354.</b></span> The <b>logical subject</b>
is the simple or grammatical subject, together with all its
modifiers.</p>
<p>The <b>logical predicate</b> is the simple or grammatical
predicate (that is, the verb), together with its modifiers, and its
object or complement.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Larger view of a sentence.</i></div>
<p>It is often a help to the student to find the logical subject
and predicate first, then the grammatical subject and predicate.
For example, in the sentence, "The situation here contemplated
exposes a dreadful ulcer, lurking far down in the depths of human
nature," the logical subject is <i>the situation here
contemplated</i>, and the rest is the logical predicate. Of this,
the simple subject is <i>situation</i>; the predicate,
<i>exposes</i>; the object, <i>ulcer</i>, etc.</p>
<h3>Independent Elements of the Sentence.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>355.</b></span> The following words and
expressions are grammatically <b>independent</b> of the rest of the
sentence; that is, they are not a necessary part, do not enter into
its structure:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Person or thing addressed</i>: "But you know them,
<i>Bishop</i>;" "<i>Ye crags and peaks</i>, I'm with you once
again."</p>
<p><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>(2) <i>Exclamatory
expressions</i>: "But the <i>lady</i>&mdash;! Oh, <i>heavens</i>!
will that spectacle ever depart from my dreams?"</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution.</i></div>
<p>The exclamatory expression, however, may be the person or thing
addressed, same as (1), above: thus, "Ah, <i>young sir</i>! what
are you about?" Or it may be an imperative, forming a sentence:
"Oh, <i>hurry, hurry</i>, my brave young man!"</p>
<p>(3) <i>Infinitive phrase</i> thrown in loosely: "<i>To make a
long story short</i>, the company broke up;" "<i>Truth to say</i>,
he was a conscientious man."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Prepositional phrase</i> not modifying: "Within the
railing sat, <i>to the best of my remembrance</i>, six
quill-driving gentlemen;" "<i>At all events</i>, the great man of
the prophecy had not yet appeared."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Participial phrase:</i> "But, <i>generally speaking</i>,
he closed his literary toils at dinner;" "<i>Considering the
burnish of her French tastes</i>, her noticing even this is
creditable."</p>
<p>(6) <i>Single words</i>: as, "Oh, <i>yes</i>! everybody knew
them;" "<i>No</i>, let him perish;" "<i>Well</i>, he somehow lived
along;" "<i>Why</i>, grandma, how you're winking!" "<i>Now</i>,
this story runs thus."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Another caution.</i></div>
<p>There are some adverbs, such as <i>perhaps</i>, <i>truly</i>,
<i>really</i>, <i>undoubtedly</i>, <i>besides</i>, etc., and some
conjunctions, such as <i>however</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>moreover</i>,
<i>therefore</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, etc., that have an office in
the sentence, and should not be confused with the words spoken of
above. The words <i>well</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>why</i>, and so on,
are independent when they merely arrest the attention without being
necessary.</p>
<p><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><b>PREPOSITIONAL
PHRASES.</b></p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>356.</b></span> In their use, prepositional
phrases may be,</p>
<p>(1) <i>Adjectival</i>, modifying a noun, pronoun, or word used
as a noun: for example, "He took the road <i>to King Richard's
pavilion</i>;" "I bring reports <i>on that subject</i> from
Ascalon."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Adverbial</i>, limiting in the same way an adverb limits:
as, "All nature around him slept <i>in calm moonshine</i> or <i>in
deep shadow</i>;" "Far <i>from the madding crowd's ignoble
strife</i>."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Independent</i>, not dependent on any word in the
sentence (for examples, see Sec. 355, 4).</p>
<h3>PARTICIPLES AND PARTICIPIAL PHRASES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>357.</b></span> It will be helpful to sum up
here the results of our study of participles and participial
phrases, and to set down all the uses which are of importance in
analysis:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>The adjectival use</i>, already noticed, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
<p>(<i>a</i>) As a complement of a transitive verb, and at the same
time a modifier of the object (for an example, see Sec. 350,
4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<i>b</i>) As a modifier of subject, object, or complement (see
Sec. 351, 6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) <i>The adverbial use</i>, modifying the predicate, instances
of which were seen in Sec. 352, 3. In these the participial phrases
connect closely with the verb, and there is no difficulty in seeing
that they modify.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>These need close watching.</i></div>
<p>There are other participial phrases which are used adverbially,
but require somewhat closer <a name="Page_248" id=
"Page_248"></a>attention; thus, "The letter of introduction,
<i>containing no matters of business</i>, was speedily run
through."</p>
<p>In this sentence, the expression <i>containing no matters of
business</i> does not describe <i>letter</i>, but it is equivalent
to <i>because it contained no matters of business</i>, and hence is
adverbial, modifying <i>was speedily run through</i>.</p>
<p>Notice these additional examples:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Being a great collector of everything relating to Milton</i>
[reason, "Because I was," etc.], I had naturally possessed myself
of Richardson the painter's thick octavo volumes.</p>
<p>Neither the one nor the other writer was valued by the public,
<i>both having</i> [since they had] <i>a long warfare to accomplish
of contumely and ridicule</i>.</p>
<p>Wilt thou, therefore, <i>being now wiser</i> [as thou art] <i>in
thy thoughts</i>, suffer God to give by seeming to refuse?</p>
<p>(3) <i>Wholly independent</i> in meaning and grammar. See Sec.
355, (5), and these additional examples:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Assuming the specific heat to be the same as that of
water</i>, the entire mass of the sun would cool down to
15,000&deg; Fahrenheit in five thousand years.</p>
<p><i>This case excepted</i>, the French have the keenest possible
sense of everything odious and ludicrous in posing.</p>
<h3>INFINITIVES AND INFINITIVE PHRASES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>358.</b></span> The various uses of the
infinitive give considerable trouble, and they will be presented
here in full, or as nearly so as the student will require.</p>
<p><b>I. The verbal use.</b> (1) Completing an incomplete verb, but
having no other office than a verbal one.</p>
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>
<p><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>(<i>a</i>) With <i>may
(might)</i>,<i>can
(could)</i>,<i>should</i>,<i>would</i>,<i>seem</i>, <i>ought</i>,
etc.: "My weekly bill used invariably <i>to be</i> about fifty
shillings;" "There, my dear, he should not <i>have known</i> them
at all;" "He would <i>instruct</i> her in the white man's religion,
and <i>teach</i> her how to be happy and good."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<i>b</i>) With the forms of <i>be</i>, being equivalent to a
future with obligation, necessity, etc.: as in the sentences,
"Ingenuity and cleverness are <i>to be rewarded</i> by State
prizes;" "'The Fair Penitent' was <i>to be acted</i> that
evening."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<i>c</i>) With the definite forms of <i>go</i>, equivalent to a
future: "I was going <i>to repeat</i> my remonstrances;" "I am not
going <i>to dissert</i> on Hood's humor."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) Completing an incomplete transitive verb, but also belonging
to a subject or an object (see Sec. 344 for explanation of the
complements of transitive verbs): "I am constrained every moment
<i>to acknowledge</i> a higher origin for events" (retained with
passive); "Do they not cause the heart <i>to beat</i>, and the eyes
<i>to fill</i>?"</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>359.</b></span> <b>II. The substantive
use</b>, already examined; but see the following examples for
further illustration:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>As the subject: "To have</i> the wall there, was to have
the foe's life at their mercy;" "<i>To teach</i> is to learn."</p>
<p>(2) <i>As the object</i>: "I like <i>to hear</i> them tell their
old stories;" "I don't wish <i>to detract</i> from any gentleman's
reputation."</p>
<p>(3) <i>As complement:</i> See examples under (1), above.</p>
<p><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>(4) <i>In apposition</i>,
explanatory of a noun preceding: as, "She forwarded to the English
leaders a touching invitation <i>to unite</i> with the French;" "He
insisted on his right <i>to forget</i> her."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>360.</b></span> <b>III. The adjectival
use</b>, modifying a noun that may be a subject, object,
complement, etc.: for example, "But there was no time <i>to be
lost</i>;" "And now Amyas had time <i>to ask</i> Ayacanora the
meaning of this;" "I have such a desire <i>to be</i> well with my
public" (see also Sec. 351, 5).</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>361.</b></span> <b>IV. The adverbial
use</b>, which may be to express&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Purpose:</i> "The governor, Don Guzman, sailed to the
eastward only yesterday <i>to look</i> for you;" "Isn't it enough
to bring us to death, <i>to please</i> that poor young gentleman's
fancy?"</p>
<p>(2) <i>Result:</i> "Don Guzman returns to the river mouth <i>to
find</i> the ship a blackened wreck;" "What heart could be so hard
as <i>not to take</i> pity on the poor wild thing?"</p>
<p>(3) <i>Reason:</i> "I am quite sorry <i>to part</i> with them;"
"Are you mad, <i>to betray</i> yourself by your own cries?" "Marry,
hang the idiot, <i>to bring me</i> such stuff!"</p>
<p>(4) <i>Degree:</i> "We have won gold enough <i>to serve</i> us
the rest of our lives;" "But the poor lady was too sad <i>to
talk</i> except to the boys now and again."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Condition:</i> "You would fancy, <i>to hear</i> McOrator
after dinner, the Scotch fighting all the battles;" "<i>To say</i>
what good of fashion we can, it rests on reality" (the last is not
a simple <a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>sentence, but it
furnishes a good example of this use of the infinitive).</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>362.</b></span> The fact that the
infinitives in Sec. 361 are used adverbially, is evident from the
meaning of the sentences.</p>
<p>Whether each sentence containing an adverbial infinitive has the
meaning of purpose, result, etc., may be found out by turning the
infinitive into an equivalent clause, such as those studied under
subordinate conjunctions.</p>
<p>To test this, notice the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>In (1), <i>to look</i> means <i>that he might look</i>; <i>to
please</i> is equivalent to <i>that he may please</i>,&mdash;both
purpose clauses.</p>
<p>In (2), <i>to find</i> shows the result of the return; <i>not to
take pity</i> is equivalent to <i>that it would not take
pity</i>.</p>
<p>In (3), <i>to part</i> means <i>because I part</i>, etc.; and
<i>to betray</i> and <i>to bring</i> express the reason, equivalent
to <i>that you betray</i>, etc.</p>
<p>In (4), <i>to serve</i> and <i>to talk</i> are equivalent to
[<i>as much gold</i>] <i>as will serve us</i>; and "too sad <i>to
talk</i>" also shows degree.</p>
<p>In (5), <i>to hear</i> means <i>if you should hear</i>, and
<i>to say</i> is equivalent to <i>if we say</i>,&mdash;both
expressing condition.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>363.</b></span> <b>V. The independent
use</b>, which is of two kinds,&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Thrown loosely into the sentence; as in Sec. 355, (3).</p>
<p>(2) <i>Exclamatory:</i> "I a philosopher! I <i>advance</i>
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>pretensions;" "'He <i>to
die</i>!' resumed the bishop." (See also Sec. 268, 4.)</p>
<h3>OUTLINE OF ANALYSIS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>364.</b></span> In analyzing simple
sentences, give&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) The predicate. If it is an incomplete verb, give the
complement (Secs. 344 and 350) and its modifiers (Sec. 351).</p>
<p>(2) The object of the verb (Sec. 349).</p>
<p>(3) Modifiers of the object (Sec. 351).</p>
<p>(4) Modifiers of the predicate (Sec. 352).</p>
<p>(5) The subject (Sec. 347).</p>
<p>(6) Modifiers of the subject (Sec. 351).</p>
<p>(7) Independent elements (Sec. 355).</p>
<p>This is not the same order that the parts of the sentence
usually have; but it is believed that the student will proceed more
easily by finding the predicate with its modifiers, object, etc.,
and then finding the subject by placing the question <i>who</i> or
<i>what</i> before it.</p>

"Page_255"></a><b>CONTRACTED SENTENCES.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Words left out after</i> than <i>or</i>
as.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>365.</b></span> Some sentences look like
simple ones in form, but have an essential part omitted that is so
readily supplied by the mind as not to need expressing. Such are
the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"There is no country more worthy of our study than England [is
worthy of our study]."</p>
<p>"The distinctions between them do not seem to be so marked as
[they are marked] in the cities."</p>
</div>
<p>To show that these words are really omitted, compare with them
the two following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The nobility and gentry are more popular among the inferior
orders than <i>they are</i> in any other country."</p>
<p>"This is not so universally the case at present as <i>it was</i>
formerly."</p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Sentences with</i> like.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>366.</b></span> As shown in Part I. (Sec.
333). the expressions <i>of manner</i> introduced by <i>like</i>,
though often treated as phrases, are really contracted clauses;
but, if they were expanded, <i>as</i> would be the connective
instead of <i>like</i>; thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>"They'll shine o'er her sleep, like [as]
a smile from the west [would shine].<br /></span> <span>From her
own loved island of sorrow."<br /></span></div>
</div>
<p>This must, however, be carefully discriminated from cases where
<i>like</i> is an adjective complement; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"She is <i>like</i> some tender tree, the pride and beauty of
the grove;" "The ruby seemed <i>like</i> a spark of fire burning
upon her white bosom."</p>
</div>
<p>Such contracted sentences form a connecting link between our
study of simple and complex sentences.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="COMPLEX_SENTENCES" id="COMPLEX_SENTENCES"></a><a name=
"Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><b>COMPLEX SENTENCES.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The simple sentence the basis.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>367.</b></span> Our investigations have now
included all the machinery of the simple sentence, which is the
<i>unit of speech</i>.</p>
<p>Our further study will be in sentences which are combinations of
simple sentences, made merely for convenience and smoothness, to
avoid the tiresome repetition of short ones of monotonous
similarity.</p>
<p>Next to the simple sentence stands the complex sentence. The
basis of it is two or more simple sentences, which are so united
that one member is the main one,&mdash;the backbone,&mdash;the
other members subordinate to it, or dependent on it; as in this
sentence,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"When such a spirit breaks forth into complaint, we are aware
how great must be the suffering that extorts the murmur."</p>
</div>
<p>The relation of the parts is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<pre>

                         <b>we  are    aware</b>
                         _______    _____
                            |         |
                          __|  <i>when such a spirit breaks</i>
                         |        <i>forth into complaint</i>,
                         |
         <i>how great must be the suffering</i>
                                   |
                     that extorts the murmur.

</pre>
<p>This arrangement shows to the eye the picture that the sentence
forms in the mind,&mdash;how the first clause is held in suspense
by the mind till the second, <b>we are aware</b>, is taken in; then
we recognize this as the main statement; and the next one, <i>how
great ... suffering</i>, drops into its place as subordinate to
<i>we are aware</i>; and the last, <i>that ... murmur</i>,
logically depends on <i>suffering</i>.</p>
<p>Hence the following definition:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_257" id=
"Page_257"></a><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>368.</b></span> A <b>complex sentence</b> is
one containing one main or independent clause (also called the
principal proposition or clause), and <i>one or more</i>
subordinate or dependent clauses.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>369.</b></span> The <b>elements</b> of a
complex sentence are the same as those of the simple sentence; that
is, each clause has its subject, predicate, object, complements,
modifiers, etc.</p>
<p>But there is this difference: whereas the simple sentence always
has a word or a phrase for subject, object, complement, and
modifier, the complex sentence has <i>statements</i> or
<i>clauses</i> for these places.</p>
<h3>CLAUSES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>370.</b></span> A clause is a division of a
sentence, containing a verb with its subject.</p>
<p>Hence the term <i>clause</i> may refer to the main division of
the complex sentence, or it may be applied to the others,&mdash;the
dependent or subordinate clauses.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Independent clause.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>371.</b></span> A <b>principal, main</b>, or
<b>independent clause</b> is one making a statement without the
help of any other clause.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Dependent clause.</i></div>
<p>A <b>subordinate</b> or <b>dependent clause</b> is one which
makes a statement depending upon or modifying some word in the
principal clause.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Kinds.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>372.</b></span> As to their office in the
sentence, clauses are divided into NOUN, ADJECTIVE, and ADVERB
clauses, according as they are equivalent in use to nouns,
adjectives, or adverbs.</p>
<p><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><b>Noun Clauses.</b></p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>373.</b></span> Noun clauses have the
following uses:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>Subject</i>: "<i>That such men should give prejudiced
views of America</i> is not a matter of surprise."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Object of a verb</i>, <i>verbal</i>, <i>or the equivalent
of a verb</i>: (<i>a</i>) "I confess <i>these stories, for a time,
put an end to my fancies</i>;" (<i>b</i>) "I am aware [I know]
<i>that a skillful illustrator of the immortal bard would have
swelled the materials</i>."</p>
<p>Just as the object noun, pronoun, infinitive, etc., is retained
after a passive verb (Sec. 352, 5), so the object clause is
retained, and should not be called an adjunct of the subject; for
example, "We are persuaded <i>that a thread runs through all
things</i>;" "I was told <i>that the house had not been shut, night
or day, for a hundred years</i>."</p>
<p>(3) <i>Complement</i>: "The terms of admission to this spectacle
are, <i>that he have a certain solid and intelligible way of
living</i>."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Apposition</i>. (<i>a</i>) Ordinary apposition,
explanatory of some noun or its equivalent: "Cecil's saying of Sir
Walter Raleigh, '<i>I know that he can toil terribly</i>,' is an
electric touch."</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) After "it <i>introductory</i>" (logically this is a
subject clause, but it is often treated as in apposition with
<i>it</i>): "<i>It</i> was the opinion of some, <i>that this might
be the wild huntsman famous in German legend</i>."</p>
<p>(5) <i>Object of a preposition</i>: "At length he reached to
<i>where the ravine had opened through the cliffs</i>."</p>
<p>Notice that frequently only the introductory <a name="Page_259"
id="Page_259"></a>word is the object of the preposition, and the
whole clause is not; thus, "The rocks presented a high impenetrable
wall, <i>over which</i> the torrent came tumbling."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>374.</b></span> Here are to be noticed
certain sentences seemingly complex, with a noun clause in
apposition with <i>it</i>; but logically they are nothing but
simple sentences. But since they are <i>complex in form</i>,
attention is called to them here; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Alas! it is we ourselves that are getting buried alive under
this avalanche of earthly impertinences."</p>
</div>
<p>To divide this into two clauses&mdash;(<i>a</i>) <i>It is we
ourselves</i>, (<i>b</i>) <i>that are ...
impertinences</i>&mdash;would be grammatical; but logically the
sentence is, <i>We ourselves are getting ... impertinences</i>, and
<i>it is ... that</i> is merely a framework used to effect
emphasis. The sentence shows how <i>it</i> may lose its pronominal
force.</p>
<p>Other examples of this construction are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It is on the understanding, and not on the sentiment, of a
nation, that all safe legislation must be based."</p>
<p>"Then it is that deliberative Eloquence lays aside the plain
attire of her daily occupation."</p>
</div>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Tell how each noun clause is used in these sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.</p>
<p>2. But the fact is, I was napping.</p>
<p>3. Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream, I
scanned more narrowly the aspect of the building.</p>
<p>4. Except by what he could see for himself, he could know
nothing.</p>
<p><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>5. Whatever he looks upon
discloses a second sense.</p>
<p>6. It will not be pretended that a success in either of these
kinds is quite coincident with what is best and inmost in his
mind.</p>
<p>7. The reply of Socrates, to him who asked whether he should
choose a wife, still remains reasonable, that, whether he should
choose one or not, he would repent it.</p>
<p>8. What history it had, how it changed from shape to shape, no
man will ever know.</p>
<p>9. Such a man is what we call an original man.</p>
<p>10. Our current hypothesis about Mohammed, that he was a
scheming impostor, a falsehood incarnate, that his religion is a
mere mass of quackery and fatuity, begins really to be no longer
tenable to any one.</p>
</div>
<h3>Adjective Clauses.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>375.</b></span> As the office of an
adjective is to modify, the only use of an adjective clause is to
limit or describe some noun, or equivalent of a noun: consequently
the adjective may modify <i>any</i> noun, or equivalent of a noun,
in the sentence.</p>
<p>The adjective clause may be introduced by the relative pronouns
<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>as</i>;
sometimes by the conjunctions <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>,
<i>whither</i>, <i>whence</i>, <i>wherein</i>, <i>whereby</i>,
etc.</p>
<p>Frequently there is no connecting word, a relative pronoun being
understood.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Examples of adjective clauses</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>376.</b></span> Adjective clauses may
modify&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) <i>The subject</i>: "The themes <i>it offers for
contemplation</i> are too vast for their capacities;" "Those <i>who
see the Englishman only in town</i>, are apt to form an unfavorable
opinion of his social character."</p>
<p>(2) <i>The object</i>: "From this piazza Ichabod en<a name=
"Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>tered the hall, <i>which formed the
center of the mansion</i>."</p>
<p>(3) <i>The complement</i>: "The animal he bestrode was a
broken-down plow-horse, <i>that had outlived almost everything but
his usefulness</i>;" "It was such an apparition <i>as is seldom to
be met with in broad daylight</i>."</p>
<p>(4) <i>Other words</i>: "He rode with short stirrups, <i>which
brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle</i>;" "No
whit anticipating the oblivion <i>which awaited their names and
feats</i>, the champions advanced through the lists;" "Charity
covereth a multitude of sins, in another sense than that <i>in
which it is said to do so in Scripture</i>."</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Pick out the adjective clauses, and tell what each one modifies;
i.e., whether subject, object, etc.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. There were passages that reminded me perhaps too much of
Massillon.</p>
<p>2. I walked home with Calhoun, who said that the principles
which I had avowed were just and noble.</p>
<p>3. Other men are lenses through which we read our own minds.</p>
<p>4. In one of those celestial days when heaven and earth meet and
adorn each other, it seems a pity that we can only spend it
once.</p>
<p>5. One of the maidens presented a silver cup, containing a rich
mixture of wine and spice, which Rowena tasted.</p>
<p>6. No man is reason or illumination, or that essence we were
looking for.</p>
<p>7. In the moment when he ceases to help us as a cause, he begins
to help us more as an effect.</p>
<p>8. Socrates took away all ignominy from the place, which could
not be a prison whilst he was there.</p>
<p>9. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear <a name=
"Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>ghosts except in our long-established
Dutch settlements.</p>
<p>10. From the moment you lose sight of the land you have left,
all is vacancy.</p>
<p>11. Nature waited tranquilly for the hour to be struck when man
should arrive.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Adverbial Clauses</b>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>377.</b></span> The adverb clause takes the
place of an adverb in modifying a verb, a verbal, an adjective, or
an adverb. The student has met with many adverb clauses in his
study of the subjunctive mood and of subordinate conjunctions; but
they require careful study, and will be given in detail, with
examples.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>378.</b></span> Adverb clauses are of the
following kinds:</p>
<p>(1) TIME: "<i>As we go</i>, the milestones are grave-stones;"
"He had gone but a little way <i>before he espied a foul fiend
coming</i>;" "<i>When he was come up to Christian</i>, he beheld
him with a disdainful countenance."</p>
<p>(2) PLACE: "<i>Wherever the sentiment of right comes in</i>, it
takes precedence of everything else;" "He went several times to
England, <i>where he does not seem to have attracted any
attention</i>."</p>
<p>(3) REASON, or CAUSE: "His English editor lays no stress on his
discoveries, <i>since he was too great to care to be original</i>;"
"I give you joy <i>that truth is altogether wholesome</i>."</p>
<p>(4) MANNER: "The knowledge of the past is valuable only <i>as it
leads us to form just calculations with respect to the future</i>;"
"After leaving the whole party under the table, he goes away <i>as
if nothing had happened</i>."</p>
<p><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>(5) DEGREE, or COMPARISON:
"They all become wiser <i>than they were</i>;" "The right
conclusion is, that we should try, so far <i>as we can</i>, to make
up our shortcomings;" "Master Simon was in as chirping a humor
<i>as a grasshopper filled with dew</i> [is];" "<i>The broader
their education is</i>, the wider is the horizon of their thought."
The first clause in the last sentence is dependent, expressing the
degree in which the horizon, etc., is wider.</p>
<p>(6) PURPOSE: "Nature took us in hand, shaping our actions, <i>so
that we might not be ended untimely by too gross
disobedience</i>."</p>
<p>(7) RESULT, or CONSEQUENCE: "He wrote on the scale of the mind
itself, <i>so that all things have symmetry in his tablet</i>;"
"The window was so far superior to every other in the church,
<i>that the vanquished artist killed himself from
mortification</i>."</p>
<p>(8) CONDITION: "<i>If we tire of the saints</i>, Shakespeare is
our city of refuge;" "Who cares for that, <i>so thou gain aught
wider and nobler</i>?" "You can die grandly, and as goddesses would
die <i>were goddesses mortal</i>."</p>
<p>(9) CONCESSION, introduced by indefinite relatives, adverbs, and
adverbial conjunctions,&mdash;<i>whoever</i>, <i>whatever</i>,
<i>however</i>, etc.: "But still, <i>however good she may be as a
witness</i>, Joanna is better;" "<i>Whatever there may remain of
illiberal in discussion</i>, there is always something illiberal in
the severer aspects of study."</p>
<p>These mean <i>no matter how good, no matter what remains</i>,
etc.</p>
<p><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><b>Exercise.</b></p>
<p>Pick out the adverbial clauses in the following sentences; tell
what kind each is, and what it modifies:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. As I was clearing away the weeds from this epitaph, the
little sexton drew me on one side with a mysterious air, and
informed me in a low voice that once upon a time, on a dark wintry
night, when the wind was unruly, howling and whistling, banging
about doors and windows, and twirling weathercocks, so that the
living were frightened out of their beds, and even the dead could
not sleep quietly in their graves, the ghost of honest Preston was
attracted by the well-known call of "waiter," and made its sudden
appearance just as the parish clerk was singing a stave from the
"mirrie garland of Captain Death."</p>
<p>2. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did,
Pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching
up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations,
that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of
a witch's anathemas.</p>
<p>3. The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit,
and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a
flame wherever it may be applied.</p>
</div>
<h3>ANALYZING COMPLEX SENTENCES.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>379.</b></span> These suggestions will be
found helpful:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) See that the sentence and all its parts are placed in the
natural order of subject, predicate, object, and modifiers.</p>
<p>(2) First take the sentence <i>as a whole</i>; find the
principal subject and principal predicate; then treat noun clauses
as nouns, adjective clauses as adjectives modifying certain words,
and adverb clauses as single modifying adverbs.</p>
<p>(3) Analyze each clause as a simple sentence. For example, in
the sentence, "Cannot we conceive that Odin was a reality?"
<i>we</i> is the prin<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>cipal
subject; <i>cannot conceive</i> is the principal predicate; its
object is <i>that Odin was a reality</i>, of which clause
<i>Odin</i> is the subject, etc.</p>

that if the church and the cataract were in the habit of giving

<p>(<i>a</i>) Analyze the following complex sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. Take the place and attitude which belong to you.</p>
<p>2. That mood into which a friend brings us is his dominion over
us.</p>
<p>3. True art is only possible on the condition that every talent
has its apotheosis somewhere.</p>
<p>4. The deep eyes, of a light hazel, were as full of sorrow as of
inspiration.</p>
<p>5. She is the only church that has been loyal to the heart and
soul of man, that has clung to her faith in the imagination.</p>
<p>6. She has never lost sight of the truth that the product human
nature is composed of the sum of flesh and spirit.</p>
<p>7. But now that she has become an establishment, she begins to
perceive that she made a blunder in trusting herself to the
intellect alone.</p>
<p>8. Before long his talk would wander into all the universe,
where it was uncertain what game you would catch, or whether
any.</p>
<p>9. The night proved unusually dark, so that the two principals
had to tie white handkerchiefs round their elbows in order to
descry each other.</p>
<p>10. Whether she would ever awake seemed to depend upon an
accident.</p>
<p>11. Here lay two great roads, not so much for travelers that
were few, as for armies that were too many by half.</p>
<p>12. It was haunted to that degree by fairies, that the parish
priest was obliged to read mass there once a year.</p>
<p>13. More than one military plan was entered upon which she did
not approve.</p>
<p>14. As surely as the wolf retires before cities, does the fairy
sequester herself from the haunts of the licensed victualer.</p>
<p>15. M. Michelet is anxious to keep us in mind that this bishop
was but an agent of the English.</p>
<p><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>16. Next came a wretched
Dominican, that pressed her with an objection, which, if applied to
the Bible, would tax every miracle with unsoundness.</p>
<p>17. The reader ought to be reminded that Joanna D'Arc was
subject to an unusually unfair trial.</p>
<p>18. Now, had she really testified this willingness on the
scaffold, it would have argued nothing at all but the weakness of a
genial nature.</p>
<p>19. And those will often pity that weakness most, who would
yield to it least.</p>
<p>20. Whether she said the word is uncertain.</p>
<p>21. This is she, the shepherd girl, counselor that had none for
herself, whom I choose, bishop, for yours.</p>
<p>22. Had <i>they</i> been better chemists, had <i>we</i> been
worse, the mixed result, namely, that, dying for <i>them</i>, the

it was no more than his daily walk, if continuously extended, would
easily reach.</p>

<p>29. Our eyes are holden that we cannot see things that stare us
in the face, until the hour arrives when the mind is ripened.</p>
<p>30. There is good reason why we should prize this
liberation.</p>
</div>
<p><i>(b)</i> First analyze, then map out as in Sec. 380, the
following complex sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. The way to speak and write what shall not go out of fashion,
is to speak and write sincerely.</p>
<p>2. The writer who takes his subject from his ear, and not from
his heart, should know that he has lost as much as he has
gained.</p>
<p>3. "No book," said Bentley, "was ever written down by any but
itself."</p>
<p><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>4. That which we do not
believe, we cannot adequately say, though we may repeat the words
never so often.</p>
<p>5. We say so because we feel that what we love is not in your
will, but above it.</p>
<p>6. It makes no difference how many friends I have, and what
content I can find in conversing with each, if there be one to whom
I am not equal.</p>
<p>7. In every troop of boys that whoop and run in each yard and
square, a new-comer is as well and accurately weighed in the course
of a few days, and stamped with his right number, as if he had
undergone a formal trial of his strength, speed, and temper.</p>

<h2><a name="COMPOUND_SENTENCES" id=
"COMPOUND_SENTENCES"></a><b>COMPOUND SENTENCES.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>How formed.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>382.</b></span> The <b>compound sentence</b>
is a combination of two or more simple or complex sentences. While
the complex sentence has only <i>one</i> main clause, the compound
has <i>two or more</i> independent clauses making statements,
questions, or commands. Hence the definition,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Definition.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>383.</b></span> A <b>compound sentence</b>
is one which contains two or more independent clauses.</p>
<p>This leaves room for any number of subordinate clauses in a
compound sentence: the requirement is simply that it have at least
two independent clauses.</p>
<p>Examples of compound sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Examples.</i></div>
<p>(1) <i>Simple sentences united:</i> "He is a palace of sweet
sounds and sights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with
arms akimbo; he soliloquizes."</p>
<p>(2) <i>Simple with complex:</i> "The trees of the forest, the
waving grass, and the peeping flowers have grown intelligent; and
he almost fears to trust them with the secret which they seem to
invite."</p>
<p><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>(3) <i>Complex with
complex:</i> "The power which resides in him is new in nature, and
none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know
until he has tried."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>384.</b></span> From this it is evident that
nothing new is added to the work of analysis already done.</p>
<p>The same analysis of simple sentences is repeated in (1) and (2)
above, and what was done in complex sentences is repeated in (2)
and (3).</p>
<p>The division into members will be easier, for the
co&ouml;rdinate independent statements are readily taken apart with
the subordinate clauses attached, if there are any.</p>
<p>Thus in (1), the semicolons cut apart the independent members,
which are simple statements; in (2), the semicolon separates the
first, a simple member, from the second, a complex member; in (3),
<i>and</i> connects the first and second complex members, and
<i>nor</i> the second and third complex members.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Connectives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>385.</b></span> The co&ouml;rdinate
conjunctions <i>and</i>, <i>nor</i>, <i>or</i> <i>but</i>, etc.,
introduce independent clauses (see Sec. 297).</p>
<p>But the conjunction is often omitted in copulative and
adversative clauses, as in Sec. 383 (1). Another example is, "Only
the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like ray"
(adversative).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Study the thought.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>386.</b></span> The one point that will give
trouble is the variable use of some connectives; as <i>but</i>,
<i>for</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>while</i> (<i>whilst</i>),
<i>however</i>, <i>whereas</i>, etc. Some of these are now
conjunctions, now adverbs or prepo<a name="Page_270" id=
"Page_270"></a>sitions; others sometimes co&ouml;rdinate, sometimes
subordinate conjunctions.</p>
<p>The student must watch <i>the logical connection</i> of the
members of the sentence, and not the form of the connective.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>Of the following illustrative sentences, tell which are
compound, and which complex:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
<p>1. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal
sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost.</p>
<p>2. I no longer wish to meet a good I do not earn, for example,
to find a pot of buried gold.</p>
<p>3. Your goodness must have some edge to it&mdash;else it is
none.</p>
<p>4. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius
admonished to stay at home, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of
water of the urns of other men.</p>
<p>5. A man cannot speak but he judges himself.</p>
<p>6. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity,
yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart
and life.</p>
<p>7. I thought that it was a Sunday morning in May; that it was
Easter Sunday, and as yet very early in the morning.</p>
<p>8. We denote the primary wisdom as intuition, whilst all later
teachings are tuitions.</p>
<p>9. Whilst the world is thus dual, so is every one of its
parts.</p>
<p>10. They measure the esteem of each other by what each has, and
not by what each is.</p>
<p>11. For everything you have missed, you have gained something
else; and for everything you gain, you lose something.</p>
<p>12. I sometimes seemed to have lived for seventy or one hundred
years in one night; nay, I sometimes had feelings representative of
a millennium, passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far
beyond the limits of experience.</p>
<p><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>13. However some may think
him wanting in zeal, the most fanatical can find no taint of
apostasy in any measure of his.</p>
<p>14. In this manner, from a happy yet often pensive child, he
grew up to be a mild, quiet, unobtrusive boy, and sun-browned with
labor in the fields, but with more intelligence than is seen in
many lads from the schools.</p>

the instinctive faith that these will call it out and reveal us to

<p>11. A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in

and they will show themselves great, though they make an exception
in your favor to all their rules of trade.</p>
<p>14. On the most profitable lie the course of events presently
lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness, puts
the parties on a convenient footing, and makes their business a
friendship.</p>
<p>15. The sturdiest offender of your peace and of the

make the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the
moment they put their horses of the sun to plow in its furrow.</p>

<p>21. Life is a train of moods like a string of beads, and as we
pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint
the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies at its
focus.</p>
<p>22. We see young men who owe us a new world, so readily and
lavishly they promise, but they never acquit the debt; they die
young, and dodge the account; or, if they live, they lose
themselves in the crowd.</p>
<p>23. So does culture with us; it ends in headache.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a><a name="Page_275"
id="Page_275"></a><b>INTRODUCTORY.</b></h2>
<div class="sidenote"><i>By way of introduction.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>388.</b></span> Syntax is from a Greek word
meaning <i>order</i> or <i>arrangement</i>.</p>
<p>Syntax deals with the relation of words to each other as
component parts of a sentence, and with their proper arrangement to
express clearly the intended meaning.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Ground covered by syntax.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>380.</b></span> Following the Latin method,
writers on English grammar usually divide syntax into the two
general heads,&mdash;<b>agreement</b> and <b>government</b>.</p>
<p><b>Agreement</b> is concerned with the following relations of
words: words in apposition, verb and subject, pronoun and
antecedent, adjective and noun.</p>
<p><b>Government</b> has to do with verbs and prepositions, both of
which are said to govern words by having them in the objective
case.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>390.</b></span> Considering the scarcity of
inflections in English, it is clear that if we merely follow the
Latin treatment, the department of syntax will be a small affair.
But there is a good deal else to watch in addition to the few
forms; for there is an important and marked difference between
Latin and English syntax. It is this:&mdash;</p>
<p>Latin syntax depends upon fixed rules governing the use of
inflected forms: hence the <i>position</i> of words in a sentence
is of little grammatical importance.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_276" id=
"Page_276"></a><i>Essential point in English syntax.</i></div>
<p>English syntax follows the Latin to a limited extent; but its
leading characteristic is, that English syntax is founded upon
<i>the meaning</i> and <i>the logical connection</i> of words
rather than upon their form: consequently it is quite as necessary
to place words properly, and to think clearly of the meaning of
words, as to study inflected forms.</p>
<p>For example, the sentence, "The savage here the settler slew,"
is ambiguous. <i>Savage</i> may be the subject, following the
regular order of subject; or <i>settler</i> may be the subject, the
order being inverted. In Latin, distinct forms would be used, and
it would not matter which one stood first.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Why study syntax?</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>391.</b></span> There is, then, a double
reason for not omitting syntax as a department of
grammar,&mdash;</p>
<p><i>First</i>, To study the rules regarding the use of inflected
forms, some of which conform to classical grammar, while some are
idiomatic (peculiar to our own language).</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, To find out the <i>logical methods</i> which
control us in the arrangement of words; and particularly when the
grammatical and the logical conception of a sentence do not agree,
or when they exist side by side in good usage.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the last remark, take the sentence,
"Besides these famous books of Scott's and Johnson's, there is a
copious 'Life' by Sheridan." In this there is a possessive form,
and added to it the preposition <i>of</i>, also expressing a
possessive relation. This is not logical; it is not consistent with
the general rules of grammar: but none the less it is good
English.</p>
<p><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>Also in the sentence, "None
remained but he," grammatical rules would require <i>him</i>
instead of <i>he</i> after the preposition; yet the expression is
sustained by good authority.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Some rules not rigid.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>392.</b></span> In some cases,
authorities&mdash;that is, standard writers&mdash;differ as to
which of two constructions should be used, or the same writer will
use both indifferently. Instances will be found in treating of the
pronoun or noun with a gerund, pronoun and antecedent, sometimes
verb and subject, etc.</p>
<p>When usage varies as to a given construction, both forms will be
given in the following pages.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The basis of syntax.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>393.</b></span> Our treatment of syntax will
be an endeavor to record the best usage of the present time on
important points; and nothing but important points will be
considered, for it is easy to confuse a student with too many
obtrusive <i>don'ts</i>.</p>
<p>The constructions presented as general will be justified by
quotations from <i>modern writers of English</i> who are regarded
as "standard;" that is, writers whose style is generally
acknowledged as superior, and whose judgment, therefore, will be
accepted by those in quest of authoritative opinion.</p>
<p>Reference will also be made to spoken English when its
constructions differ from those of the literary language, and to
vulgar English when it preserves forms which were once, but are not
now, good English.</p>
<p>It may be suggested to the student that the only way to acquire
correctness is to watch good usage <i>everywhere</i>, and imitate
it.<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></p>

<h2><a name="NOUNSIII" id="NOUNSIII"></a><b>NOUNS.</b></h2>
<p><span class="sn"><b>394.</b></span> Nouns have no distinct forms
for the nominative and objective cases: hence no mistake can be
made in using them. But some remarks are required concerning the
use of the possessive case.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the possessive. Joint
possession.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>395.</b></span> When two or more possessives

<h3>PERSONAL PRONOUNS.</h3>
<h3>I. NOMINATIVE AND OBJECTIVE FORMS.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>398.</b></span> Since most of the personal
pronouns, together with the relative <i>who</i>, have separate
forms for nominative and objective use, there are two general rules
that require attention.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>General rules.</i></div>
<p>(1) The <i>nominative use</i> is usually marked by the
nominative form of the pronoun.</p>
<p>(2) The <i>objective use</i> is usually marked by the objective
form of the pronoun.</p>
<p>These simple rules are sometimes violated in spoken and in
literary English. Some of the violations are universally condemned;
others are generally, if not universally, sanctioned.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Objective for the nominative.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>399.</b></span> The objective is sometimes
found instead of the nominative in the following
instances:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) By a common vulgarism of ignorance or carelessness, no
notice is taken of the proper form to be used as subject;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>He and <i>me</i> once went in the dead of winter in a one-hoss
shay out to Boonville.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Whitcher,</span>
<i>Bedott Papers.</i></p>
<p>It seems strange to me that <i>them</i> that preach up the
doctrine don't admire one who carrys it out.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap"><i>Josiah Allens Wife.</i></span></p>
</div>
<p>(2) By faulty analysis of the sentence, the true relation of the
words is misunderstood; for exam<a name="Page_280" id=
"Page_280"></a>ple, "<i>Whom</i> think ye that I am?" (In this,
<i>whom</i> is the complement after the verb <i>am</i>, and should
be the nominative form, <i>who</i>.) "The young Harper, <i>whom</i>
they agree was rather nice-looking" (<i>whom</i> is the subject of
the verb <i>was</i>).</p>
<p>Especially is this fault to be noticed after an ellipsis with
<i>than</i> or <i>as</i>, the real thought being forgotten;
thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>But the consolation coming from devotion did not go far with
such a one as <i>her</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Trollope.</span></p>
</div>
<p>This should be "as <i>she</i>," because the full expression
would be "such a one as <i>she is</i>."</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>400.</b></span> Still, the last expression
has the support of many good writers, as shown in the following
examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>She was neither better bred nor wiser than you or
<i>me</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>No mightier than thyself or <i>me</i>.<span class=

"smcap">&mdash;Byron.</span></p>
<p>I shall not learn my duty from such as <i>thee</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Fielding.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A safe rule.</i></div>
<p>It will be safer for the student to follow the general rule, as
illustrated in the following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>If so, they are yet holier than <i>we</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
<p>Who would suppose it is the game of such as

</div>

"smcap">&mdash;Milton.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>I have no other saint than <i>thou</i> to pray to.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Longfellow.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">"<i>Than</i> whom."</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>401.</b></span> One exception is to be
noted. The expression <b>than whom</b> seems to be used universally
instead of "than <i>who</i>." There is no special reason for this,
but such is the fact; for example,&mdash;<a name="Page_281" id=
"Page_281"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>One I remember especially,&mdash;one <i>than whom</i> I never
met a bandit more gallant.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>The camp of Richard of England, <i>than whom</i> none knows
better how to do honor to a noble foe.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
<p>She had a companion who had been ever agreeable, and her estate
a steward <i>than whom</i> no one living was supposed to be more
competent.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Parton.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">"<i>It was</i> he" <i>or</i> "<i>It was</i>
him"?</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>402.</b></span> And there is one question
about which grammarians are not agreed, namely, whether the
nominative or the objective form should be used in the predicate
after <i>was</i>, <i>is</i>, <i>are</i>, and the other forms of the
verb <i>be</i>.</p>
<p>It may be stated with assurance that the literary language
<i>prefers the nominative</i> in this instance, as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>For there was little doubt that it was <i>he</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>But still it is not <i>she</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>And it was <i>he</i><br /></span>
<span>That made the ship to go.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Coleridge.</span></div>
</div>
<p>In spoken English, on the other hand, both in England and
America, the objective form is regularly found, unless a special,
careful effort is made to adopt the standard usage. The following
are examples of spoken English from conversations:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Rose Satterne, the mayor's daughter?"&mdash;"That's
<i>her</i>."<span class="smcap">&mdash;Kingsley.</span></p>
<p>"Who's there?"&mdash;"<i>Me</i>, Patrick the
Porter."<span class="smcap">&mdash;Winthrop.</span></p>
<p>"If there is any one embarrassed, it will not be
<i>me</i>."<span class="smcap">&mdash;Wm. Black.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The usage is too common to need further examples.</p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote">Me <i>in exclamations</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>403.</b></span> It is to be remembered that
the objective form is used in exclamations which turn the attention
upon a person; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Unhappy <i>me!</i> That I cannot risk my own worthless
life.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Kingsley</span></p>
<p>Alas! miserable <i>me</i>! Alas! unhappy
Se&ntilde;ors!&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
<p>Ay <i>me</i>! I fondly dream&mdash;had ye been
there.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Milton.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote">Nominative for the objective.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>404.</b></span> The rule for the objective
form is wrongly departed from&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) When the object is far removed from the verb, verbal, or
preposition which governs it; as, "<i>He</i> that can doubt whether
he be anything or no, I speak not to" (<i>he</i> should be
<i>him</i>, the object of <i>to</i>); "I saw men very like him at
each of the places mentioned, but not <i>he</i>" (<i>he</i> should
be <i>him</i>, object of <i>saw</i>).</p>
<p>(2) In the case of certain pairs of pronouns, used after verbs,
verbals, and prepositions, as this from Shakespeare, "All debts are
cleared be<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>tween you and I"
(for <i>you</i> and <i>me</i>); or this, "Let <i>thou</i> and
<i>I</i> the battle try" (for <i>thee</i> and <i>me</i>, or
<i>us</i>).</p>
<p>(3) By forgetting the construction, in the case of words used in
apposition with the object; as, "Ask the murderer, <i>he</i> who
has steeped his hands in the blood of another" (instead of
"<i>him</i> who," the word being in apposition with
<i>murderer</i>).</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Exception 1</i>, who
<i>interrogative</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>405.</b></span> The interrogative pronoun
<b>who</b> may be said to have no objective form in spoken English.
We regularly say, "<i>Who</i> did you see?" or, "<i>Who</i> were
they talking to?" etc. The more formal "To <i>whom</i> were they
talking?" sounds stilted in conversation, and is usually
avoided.</p>
<p>In literary English the objective form <i>whom</i> is
<i>preferred</i> for objective use; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Knows he now to <i>whom</i> he lies under
obligation?<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
<p>What doth she look on? <i>Whom</i> doth she behold?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Wordsworth.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Yet the nominative form is found quite frequently to divide the
work of the objective use; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<i>who</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Exception 2, but</i> he, <i>etc.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>406.</b></span> It is a well-established
usage to put the nominative form, as well as the objective, after

<h3>II. POSSESSIVE FORMS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>As antecedent of a relative.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>407.</b></span> The possessive forms of
personal pronouns and also of nouns are sometimes found as
antecedents of relatives. This usage is not frequent. The
antecedent is usually nominative or objective, as the use of the
possessive is less likely to be clear.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We should augur ill of any <i>gentleman's</i> property to whom
this happened every other day in his drawing room.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Preceding a gerund,&mdash;possessive, or
objective?</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>408.</b></span> Another point on which there
is some variance in usage is such a construction as this: "We heard
of <i>Brown</i> studying law," or "We heard of <i>Brown's</i>
studying law."</p>
<p>That is, should the possessive case of a noun or pronoun always
be used with the gerund to indicate the active agent? Closely
scrutinizing these two sentences quoted, we might find a difference
between them: saying that in the first one <i>studying</i> is a
participle, and the meaning is, <i>We heard of Brown</i>, [who was]
<i>studying law</i>; and that in the second, <i>studying</i> is a
gerund, object of <i>heard of</i>, and modified by the possessive
case as any other substantive would be.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><i>Why
both are found.</i></div>
<p>But in common use there is no such distinction. Both types of
sentences are found; both are gerunds; sometimes the gerund has the
possessive form before it, sometimes it has the objective. The use
of the objective is older, and in keeping with the old way of
regarding the <i>person</i> as the chief object before the mind:
the possessive use is more modern, in keeping with the disposition
to proceed from the material thing to the <i>abstract idea</i>, and
to make the action substantive the chief idea before the mind.</p>
<p>In the examples quoted, it will be noticed that the possessive
of the pronoun is more common than that of the noun.</p>

</div>
<p><b>III. PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND THEIR ANTECEDENTS</b>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>409.</b></span> The pronouns of the third
person usually refer back to some preceding noun or pronoun, and
ought to agree with them in person, number, and gender.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Watch for the real antecedent.</i></div>
<p>There are two constructions in which the student will need to
watch the pronoun,&mdash;when the antecedent, in one person, is
followed by a phrase containing a pronoun of a different person;
and when the antecedent is of such a form that the pronoun
following cannot indicate exactly the gender. Examples of these
constructions are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Those</i> of us who can only maintain <i>themselves</i> by
continuing in some business or salaried office.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
<p>Suppose the life and fortune of <i>every one</i> of us would
depend on <i>his</i> winning or losing a game of chess.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Huxley.</span></p>
<p>If <i>any one</i> did not know it, it was <i>his</i> own
fault.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Cable.</span></p>
<p><i>Everybody</i> had <i>his</i> own life to think
of.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Defoe.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>410.</b></span> In such a case as the last
three sentences,&mdash;when the antecedent includes both masculine
and feminine, or is a distributive word, taking in each of many
persons,&mdash;the preferred method is to put <a name="Page_288"
id="Page_288"></a>the pronoun following in the masculine singular;
if the antecedent is neuter, preceded by a distributive, the
pronoun will be neuter singular.</p>
<p>The following are additional examples:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The next <i>correspondent</i> wants you to mark out a whole
course of life for <i>him</i>.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Holmes.</span></p>
<p>Every <i>city</i> threw open <i>its</i> gates.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p>Every <i>person</i> who turns this page has <i>his</i> own
little diary.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>The pale realms of shade, where
<i>each</i> shall take<br /></span> <span><i>His</i> chamber in the
silent halls of death.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Bryant.<br /></span></div>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Avoided: By using both pronouns.</i></div>
<p>Sometimes this is avoided by using both the masculine and the
feminine pronoun; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Not the feeblest <i>grandame</i>, not a mowing <i>idiot</i>, but
uses what spark of perception and faculty is left, to chuckle and
triumph in <i>his or her</i> opinion.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
<p>It is a game which has been played for untold ages, every
<i>man</i> and <i>woman</i> of us being one of the two players in a
game of <i>his or her</i> own.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Huxley.</span></p>
</div>
<p><i>By using the plural pronoun.</i></p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>411.</b></span> Another way of referring to
an antecedent which is a distributive pronoun or a noun modified by
a distributive adjective, is to use the plural of the pronoun
following. This is not considered the best usage, the logical
analysis requiring the singular pronoun in each case; but the
construction is frequently found <i>when the antecedent includes or
implies both genders</i>. The masculine does not really represent a

<h3>RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<h3>I. RESTRICTIVE AND UNRESTRICTIVE RELATIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>What these terms mean.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>412.</b></span> As to their conjunctive use,
the definite relatives <b>who</b>, <b>which</b>, and <b>that</b>
may be <b>co&ouml;rdinating</b> or <b>restrictive</b>.</p>
<p>A relative, when co&ouml;rdinating, or unrestrictive, is
equivalent to a conjunction (<i>and</i>, <i>but</i>,
<i>because</i>, <a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>etc.) and a
personal pronoun. It adds a new statement to what precedes, that
being considered already clear; as, "I gave it to the beggar,
<i>who</i> went away." This means, "I gave it to the beggar [we
know which one], <i>and he</i> went away."</p>
<p>A relative, when restrictive, introduces a clause to limit and
make clear some preceding word. The clause is restricted to the
antecedent, and does not add a new statement; it merely couples a
thought necessary to define the antecedent: as, "I gave it to a
beggar <i>who</i> stood at the gate." It defines <i>beggar</i>.</p>
<p><span class="sn"><b>413.</b></span> It is sometimes contended
that <b>who</b> and <b>which</b> should always be
co&ouml;rdinating, and <b>that</b> always restrictive; but,
according to the practice of every modern writer, the usage must be
stated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A loose rule the only one to be
formulated.</i></div>
<p><b>Who</b> and <b>which</b> are either co&ouml;rdinating or
restrictive, the taste of the writer and regard for euphony being
the guide.</p>
<p><b>That</b> is in most cases restrictive, the co&ouml;rdinating
use not being often found among careful writers.</p>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>In the following examples, tell whether <i>who</i>,

</div>
<h3>II. RELATIVE AND ANTECEDENT.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The rule.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>414.</b></span> The general rule is, that
the relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in person and
number.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>In what sense true.</i></div>
<p>This cannot be true as to the form of the pronoun, as that does
not vary for person or number. We say <i>I</i>, <i>you</i>,
<i>he</i>, <i>they</i>, etc., <i>who</i>; <i>these</i> or
<i>that</i> <i>which</i>, etc. However, the relative <i>carries
over</i> the agreement from the antecedent before to the verb
following, so far as the verb has forms to show its agreement with
a substantive. For example, in the sentence, "He that writes to
himself writes to an eternal public," <i>that</i> is invariable as
to person <a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>and number, but,
because of its antecedent, it makes the verb third person
singular.</p>
<p>Notice the agreement in the following sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is not <i>one</i> of the company, but <i>myself</i>, who
rarely <i>speak</i> at all, but <i>speaks</i> of him as that sort,
etc.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Addison.</span></p>
<p>O <i>Time!</i> who <i>know'st</i> a lenient hand to lay Softest
on sorrow's wound.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Bowles.</span></p>
<p>Let us be of good cheer, remembering that the misfortunes
hardest to bear are <i>those</i> which never
<i>come.</i><span class="smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A disputed point.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>415.</b></span> This prepares the way for
the consideration of one of the vexed questions,&mdash;whether we
should say, "one of the finest books that <i>has</i> been
published," or, "one of the finest books that <i>have</i> been
published."</p>
<div class="sidenote">One of ... [<i>plural</i>] that who,
<i>or</i> which ... [<i>singular or plural</i>.]</div>
<p>Both constructions are frequently found, the reason being a
difference of opinion as to the antecedent. Some consider it to be
<i>one</i> [book] <i>of the finest books</i>, with <i>one</i> as
the principal word, the true antecedent; others regard <i>books</i>
as the antecedent, and write the verb in the plural. The latter is
rather more frequent, but the former has good authority.</p>
<p>The following quotations show both sides:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Plural.</i></div>

<h3>III. OMISSION OF THE RELATIVE.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>416.</b></span> Although the omission of the
relative is common when it would be the object of the verb or
preposition <i>expressed</i>, there is an omission which is not
frequently found in careful writers; that is, when the relative
word is a pronoun, object of a preposition <i>understood</i>, or is
equivalent to the conjunction <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>,
<i>whence</i>, and such like: as, "He returned by the same route
[by which] he came;" "India is the place [in which, or where] he
died." Notice these sentences:&mdash;<a name="Page_294" id=

</div>
<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;In the above sentences, insert the
omitted conjunction or phrase, and see if the sentence is made
clearer.</p>
<h3>IV. THE RELATIVE <i>AS</i> AFTER <i>SAME</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="sn"><b>417.</b></span> It is very rarely that we
find such sentences as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>He considered...me as his apprentice, and accordingly expected
the same service from me <i>as</i> he would from
another.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Franklin.</span></p>
<p>This has the same effect in natural faults <i>as</i> maiming and
mutilation produce from accidents.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Burke.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The regular construction</i>.</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Caution</i>.</div>
<p>The usual way is to use the relative <i>as</i> after <i>same</i>
if no verb follows <i>as;</i> but, if <i>same</i> is followed by a
complete clause, <i>as</i> is not used, but we find the relative
<i>who, which,</i> or <i>that</i>. Remember this applies only to
<i>as</i> when used as a relative.</p>
<p>Examples of the use of <i>as</i> in a contracted
clause:&mdash;<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Looking to the same end <i>as</i> Turner, and working in the
same spirit, he, with Turner, was a discoverer,
etc.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. W. Church</span>.</p>
<p>They believe the same of all the works of art, <i>as</i> of
knives, boats, looking-glasses.<span class=

<p>Examples of relatives following <i>same</i> in full
clauses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote">Who.</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>This is the very same rogue <i>who</i> sold us the spectacles.
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>

<p>With the same minuteness <i>which</i> her predecessor had
exhibited, she passed the lamp over her face and
person.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
</div>
<h3>V. MISUSE OF RELATIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Anacoluthic use of</i> which.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>418.</b></span> There is now and then found
in the pages of literature a construction which imitates the Latin,
but which is usually carefully avoided. It is a use of the relative
<i>which</i> so as to make an anacoluthon, or lack of proper
connection between the clauses; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Which</i>, if I had resolved to go on with, I might as well
have staid at home.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Defoe</span></p>
<p><i>Which</i> if he attempted to do, Mr. Billings vowed that he
would follow him to Jerusalem.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>We know not the incantation of the heart that would wake
them;&mdash;<i>which</i> if they once heard, they would start up to

<p>He delivered the letter, <i>which</i> when Mr. Thornhill had
read, he said that all submission was now too late.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Goldsmith.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>But still the house affairs would draw
her thence;<br /></span> <span><i>Which</i> ever as she could with
haste dispatch,<br /></span> <span>She'd come again.<br /></span>
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare.</span></div>
</div>
<p><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>As the sentences stand,
<i>which</i> really has no office in the sentence: it should be
changed to a demonstrative or a personal pronoun, and this be
placed in the proper clause.</p>
<p><b>Exercise.</b>&mdash;Rewrite the above five sentences so as to
make the proper grammatical connection in each.</p>
<div class="sidenote">And who, and which, <i>etc.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>419.</b></span> There is another kind of
expression which slips into the lines of even standard authors, but
which is always regarded as an oversight and a blemish.</p>
<p>The following sentence affords an example: "The rich are now
engaged in distributing what remains among the poorer sort, <i>and
who</i> are now thrown upon their compassion." The trouble is that
such conjunctions as <i>and</i>, <i>but</i>, <i>or</i>, etc.,
should connect expressions of the same kind: <i>and who</i> makes
us look for a preceding <i>who</i>, but none is expressed. There
are three ways to remedy the sentence quoted: thus, (1) "Among
those <i>who</i> are poor, <i>and who</i> are now," etc.; (2)
"Among the poorer sort, <i>who</i> are now thrown," etc.; (3)
"Among the poorer sort, now thrown upon their," etc. That
is,&mdash;</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote">Each other, one another.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>421.</b></span> The student is sometimes
troubled whether to use <b>each other</b> or <b>one another</b> in
expressing reciprocal relation or action. Whether either one refers
to a certain number of persons or objects, whether or not the two
are equivalent, may be gathered from a study of the following
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once I took such delight in Montaigne ...; before that, in

</div>
<div class="sidenote">Any <i>usually plural</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>423.</b></span> The adjective pronoun

<div class="sidenote">None <i>usually plural</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>424.</b></span> The adjective pronoun
<b>none</b> is, in the prose of the present day, usually plural,
although it is historically a contraction of <i>ne &#257;n</i> (not

</div>
<p>Like the use of <i>any</i>, the pronoun <i>none</i> should be
distinguished from the adjective <i>none</i>, which is used

<h2><a name="ADJECTIVESIII" id=

<h3>AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES WITH NOUNS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote">These sort, all manner of, <i>etc.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>427.</b></span> The statement that
adjectives agree with their nouns in number is restricted to the
words <b>this</b> and <b>that</b> (with <b>these</b> and
<b>those</b>), as these are the only adjectives that have separate
forms for singular and plural; and it is only in one set of
expressions that the concord seems to be violated,&mdash;in such as
"<i>these sort</i> of books," "<i>those kind</i> of trees," "<i>all
manner</i> of men;" the nouns being singular, the adjectives
plural. These expressions are all but universal in spoken English,
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>and may be found not
infrequently in literary English; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span><i>These kind</i> of knaves I know, which
in this plainness<br /></span> <span>Harbor more craft,
etc.<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Shakespeare</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>All <i>these sort</i> of things.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Sheridan.</span></p>
<p>I hoped we had done with <i>those sort</i> of
things.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Muloch.</span></p>
<p>You have been so used to <i>those sort</i> of
impertinences.<span class="smcap">Sydney Smith.</span></p>
<p>Whitefield or Wesley, or some other such great man as a bishop,
or <i>those sort</i> of people.<span class=

<p>There are women as well as men who can thoroughly enjoy <i>those
sort</i> of romantic spots.&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>,
London.</p>
<p>The library was open, with <i>all manner</i> of amusing
books.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Ruskin.</span></p>
</div>
<p>According to the approved usage of Modern English, each one of
the above adjectives would have to be changed to the singular, or
the nouns to the plural.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>History of this construction.</i></div>
<p>The reason for the prevalence of these expressions must be
sought in the history of the language: it cannot be found in the
statement that the adjective is made plural by the attraction of a
noun following.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>At the source.</i></div>
<p>In Old and Middle English, in keeping with the custom of looking
at things concretely rather than in the abstract, they said, not
"all <i>kinds</i> of wild animals," but "alles cunnes wilde deor"
(wild animals of-every-kind). This the modern expression
reverses.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Later form.</i></div>
<p>But in early Middle English the modern way of regarding such
expressions also appeared, gradually displacing the old.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The result.</i></div>
<p>Consequently we have a confused expression. <a name="Page_305"
id="Page_305"></a>We keep the form of logical agreement in standard
English, such as, "<i>This sort</i> of trees should be planted;"
but at the same time the noun following <i>kind of</i> is felt to
be the real subject, and the adjective is, in spoken English, made
to agree with it, which accounts for the construction, "<i>These
kind of</i> trees are best."</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A question.</i></div>
<p>The inconvenience of the logical construction is seen when we
wish to use a predicate with number forms. Should we say, "This
kind of rules <i>are</i> the best," or "This kind of rules
<i>is</i> the best?" <i>Kind</i> or <i>sort</i> may be treated as a
collective noun, and in this way may take a plural verb; for
example, Burke's sentence, "A <i>sort</i> of uncertain sounds
<i>are</i>, when the necessary dispositions concur, more alarming
than a total silence."</p>
<h3>COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE FORMS.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the comparative degree.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>428.</b></span> The comparative degree of
the adjective (or adverb) is used when we wish to compare two
objects or sets of objects, or one object with a class of objects,
to express a higher degree of quality; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Which is <i>the better</i> able to defend himself,&mdash;a
strong man with nothing but his fists, or a paralytic cripple
encumbered with a sword which he cannot lift?<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span>Of two such lessons, why
forget<br /></span> <span class="i2">The <i>nobler</i> and the
<i>manlier</i> one?<br /></span> <span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Byron.</span></div>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We may well doubt which has the <i>stronger</i> claim to
civilization, the victor or the vanquished.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Prescott.</span></p>
<p>A <i>braver</i> ne'er to battle rode.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Scott.</span></p>
<p>He is <i>taller,</i> by almost the breadth of my nail, than any
of his court.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Swift.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>Other
<i>after the comparative form.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>429.</b></span> When an object is compared
with the class to which it belongs, it is regularly excluded from
that class by the word <i>other</i>; if not, the object would
really be compared with itself: thus,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The character of Lady Castlewood has required more delicacy in
its manipulation than perhaps any <i>other</i> which Thackeray has
drawn.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Trollope.</span></p>
<p>I used to watch this patriarchal personage with livelier
curiosity than any <i>other</i> form of humanity.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<h4>Exercise.</h4>
<p>See if the word <i>other</i> should be inserted in the following
sentences:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. There was no man who could make a more graceful bow than Mr.
Henry.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Wirt.</span></p>
<p>2. I am concerned to see that Mr. Gary, to whom Dante owes more
than ever poet owed to translator, has sanctioned, etc.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Macaulay.</span></p>
<p>3. There is no country in which wealth is so sensible of its
obligations as our own.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Lowell.</span></p>
<p>4. This is more sincerely done in the Scandinavian than in any
mythology I know.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Carlyle.</span></p>
<p>5. In "Thaddeus of Warsaw" there is more crying than in any
novel I remember to have read.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Thackeray.</span></p>
<p>6. The heroes of another writer [Cooper] are quite the equals of
Scott's men; perhaps Leather-stocking is better than any one in
"Scott's lot."&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Id.</i></span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Use of the superlative degree.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>430.</b></span> The <b>superlative
degree</b> of the adjective (or adverb) is used regularly in
comparing more than two things, but is also frequently used in
comparing only two things.</p>
<p>Examples of superlative with several objects:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is a case of which the <i>simplest</i> statement is the

"Let us see which will laugh <i>loudest</i>."<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Hawthorne.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Double comparative and
superlative.</i></div>
<p>431. In Shakespeare's time it was quite common to use a double
comparative and superlative by using <i>more</i> or <i>most</i>
before the word already having <i>-er</i> or <i>-est</i>. Examples
from Shakespeare are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>How much <i>more elder</i> art thou than thy
looks!&mdash;<i>Merchant of Venice.</i></p>
<p>Nor that I am <i>more better</i> than
Prospero.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>Tempest.</i></span></p>
<p>Come you <i>more nearer</i>.&mdash;<span class=
"smcap"><i>Hamlet.</i></span></p>
<p>With the <i>most boldest</i> and best hearts of
Rome.&mdash;<span class="smcap"><i>J. C&aelig;sar.</i></span></p>

<p>After the <i>most straitest</i> sect of our

</div>
<p>Such expressions are now heard only in vulgar English. The
following examples are used purposely, to represent the characters
as ignorant persons:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The artful saddler persuaded the young traveler to look at "the

necessary to say more than that both are in good use; not only so
in popular speech, but in literary English. Instances of both are
given below.</p>
<p>The meaning intended is the same, and the reader gets the same

<div class="sidenote"><i>Definite article</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>433.</b></span> The <b>definite article</b>
is repeated before each of two modifiers of the same noun, when the
purpose is to call attention to the noun expressed and the one
understood. In such a case two or more separate objects are usually
indicated by the separation of the modifiers. Examples of this
construction are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>With a singular noun</i>.</div>
<div class="blockquot">

</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>434.</b></span> The same repetition of the

clearly, or to emphasize the meaning; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote">The <i>not repeated. One object and several

<p><span class="sn"><b>435.</b></span> Frequently, however, the
article is not repeated before each of two or more adjectives, as
in Sec. 433, but is used with one only; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Or fanciest thou <i>the red and yellow</i> Clothes-screen yonder

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Indefinite article</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>436.</b></span> The <b>indefinite
article</b> is used, like the definite article, to limit two or
more modified nouns, only one of which is expressed. The article is
repeated for the purpose of separating or emphasizing the modified
nouns. Examples of this use are,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>We shall live <i>a better</i> and <i>a higher</i> and <i>a
nobler</i> life.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Beecher.</span></p>
<p>The difference between the products of <i>a well-disciplined</i>

<p>As if the difference between <i>an accurate</i> and <i>an

<p>To every room there was <i>an open</i> and <i>a secret</i>
passage.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Johnson.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that in the above sentences (except the first) the noun
expressed is in contrast with the modified noun omitted.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>One article with several
adjectives.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>437.</b></span> Usually the article is not
repeated when the several adjectives unite in describing one and
the same noun. In the sentences of Secs. 433 and 436, one noun is
expressed; yet the same word understood with the other adjectives
has a different meaning (except in the first sentence of Sec. 436).
But in the following sentences, as in the first three of Sec. 435,
the adjectives assist each other in describing the same noun. It is
easy to see the difference between the expressions "<i>a
red-and-white</i> geranium," and "<i>a red and a white</i>
geranium."</p>
<p>Examples of several adjectives describing the same
object:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>To inspire us with <i>a free and quiet</i>
mind.&mdash;<span class="smcap">B. Jonson</span>.</p>
<p>Here and there <i>a desolate and uninhabited</i>
house.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Dickens.</span></p>

strain,<br /></span> <span><i>An early, rich, and inexhausted</i>

</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>For rhetorical effect.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>438.</b></span> The indefinite article
(compare Sec. 434) is used to lend special emphasis, interest, or
clearness to each of several nouns; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>James was declared <i>a</i> mortal and bloody <i>enemy, a
tyrant, a murderer</i>, and <i>a usurper</i>.<span class=

<h3>CONCORD OF VERB AND SUBJECT IN NUMBER.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>A broad and loose rule.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>439.</b></span> In English, the
<b>number</b> of the verb follows the meaning rather than the form
of its subject.</p>
<p>It will not do to state as a general rule that the verb agrees
with its subject in person and number. This was spoken of in Part
I., Sec. 276, and the following illustrations prove it.</p>
<p>The statements and illustrations of course refer to such verbs
as have separate forms for singular and plural number.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Singular verb.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>440.</b></span> The <b>singular form</b> of
the verb is used&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Subject of singular form.</i></div>
<p>(1) When the subject has a singular form and a singular
meaning.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Such, then, <i>was</i> the earliest American
<i>land</i>.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Agassiz.</span></p>
<p><i>He was</i> certainly a happy fellow at this
time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Eliot</span>.</p>
<p><i>He sees</i> that it is better to live in peace.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Cooper.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Collective noun of singular
meaning.</i></div>
<p>(2) When the subject is a <i>collective noun</i> which
represents a number of persons or things <i>taken as one unit</i>;
as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The larger <i>breed</i> [of camels] <i>is</i> capable of
transporting a weight of a thousand pounds.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Gibbon.</span></p>
<p>Another <i>school professes</i> entirely opposite
principles.&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>
<p>In this work there <i>was</i> grouped around him <i>a score</i>
of men.<span class="smcap">&mdash;W. Phillips</span></p>
<p>A <i>number</i> of jeweled paternosters <i>was</i> attached to
her girdle.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Froude.</span></p>
<p><i>Something like a horse load</i> of books <i>has</i> been
written to prove that it was the beauty who blew up the
booby.<span class="smcap">&mdash;Carlyle</span></p>
</div>
<p>This usage, like some others in this series, depends mostly on
the writer's own judgment. <a name="Page_313" id=
"Page_313"></a>Another writer might, for example, prefer a plural
verb after <i>number</i> in Froude's sentence above.</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Singulars connected by</i> or <i>or</i>
nor.</div>
<p>(3) When the subject consists of two or more singular nouns
connected by <i>or</i> or <i>nor</i>; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is by no means sure that either our <i>literature</i>, or the
great intellectual <i>life</i> of our nation, <i>has</i> got
already, without academies, all that academies can
give.&mdash;<span class="smcap">M. Arnold</span>.</p>
<p><i>Jesus is</i> not dead, nor <i>John</i>, nor <i>Paul</i>, nor
<i>Mahomet</i>. <span class="smcap">&mdash;Emerson.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Plural form and singular
meaning.</i></div>
<p>(4) When the subject is <i>plural in form</i>, but represents a
number of things to be taken together as <i>forming one unit</i>;
for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Thirty-four years <i>affects</i> one's remembrance of some
circumstances.<span class="smcap">&mdash;De Quincey.</span></p>
<p>Between ourselves, three pounds five shillings and two pence

"smcap">&mdash;Montague</span></p>
<p>Two thirds of this <i>is</i> mine by right.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Sheridan</span></p>
<p>The singular form is also used with book titles, other names,
and other singulars of plural form; as,&mdash;</p>
<p>Politics <i>is</i> the only field now open for me.<span class=
"smcap">&mdash;Whittier.</span></p>
<p>"Sesame and Lilies" <i>is</i> Ruskin's creed for young

<div class="sidenote"><i>Subjects after the verb.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>General usage</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>442.</b></span> If there is only one person

different persons: as,&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Second or third and first person in the
subject</i>.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>443.</b></span> If the subject is made up of
the first person joined with the second or third by <i>and</i>, the
verb takes the construction of the first person, the subject being
really equivalent to <i>we</i>; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="sn"><b>444.</b></span> When the subjects, of

</div>
<p>This construction is at the best a little awkward. It is avoided
either by using a verb which has no <a name="Page_318" id=
"Page_318"></a>forms for person (as, "He or I <i>can</i> go," "She
or you <i>may</i> be sure," etc.), or by rearranging the sentence
so as to throw each subject before its proper person form (as, "You
<i>would</i> not be wiser, nor <i>should</i> I;" or, "I <i>have</i>
never said so, nor <i>has</i> she").</p>

<p>In this sentence from Defoe, "I expected every wave would have

<p><span class="sn"><b>449.</b></span> From these illustrations
will be readily seen the grammatical changes made in transferring
from direct to indirect discourse. Remember the following
facts:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Usually the main, introductory verb is in the past
tense.</p>
<p>(2) The indirect quotation is usually introduced by <i>that</i>,
and the indirect question by <i>whether</i> or <i>if</i>, or
regular interrogatives.</p>
<p>(3) Verbs in the present-tense form are changed to the
past-tense form. This includes the auxiliaries <i>be</i>,
<i>have</i>, <i>will</i>, etc. The past tense is sometimes changed
to the past perfect.</p>
<p>(4) The pronouns of the first and second persons are all changed
to the third person. Sometimes it is clearer to introduce the
antecedent of the pronoun instead.</p>
<p>Other examples of indirect discourse have been <a name=

pronouns, interrogative adverbs, and the subjunctive mood of
verbs.</p>

meaning.</p>
<p>The rigid rule in such a case would be, to put the modifier in
such a position that the reader not only can understand the meaning
intended, but <i>cannot misunderstand</i> the thought. Now, when
such adverbs as <i>only</i>, <i>even</i>, etc., are used, they are
usually placed in a strictly correct position, if they modify
single words; but they are often removed from the exact position,
if they modify phrases or clauses: for example, from Irving, "The
site is <i>only</i> to be traced by fragments of bricks, china, and
earthenware." Here <i>only</i> modifies the phrase <i>by fragments
of bricks</i>, etc., but it is placed before the infinitive. This

<h3>USE OF DOUBLE NEGATIVES.</h3>
<div class="sidenote"><i>The old usage.</i></div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>453.</b></span> In Old and Middle English,
two negatives strengthened a negative idea; for example,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">

</div>
<p>The first of these is equivalent to "He didn't never say no
villainy in all his life to no manner of man,"&mdash;four
negatives.</p>
<p>This idiom was common in the older stages of the language, and
is still kept in vulgar English; as,&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote"><i>Regular law of negative in modern
English.</i></div>
<p>But, under the influence of Latin syntax, the usual way of
regarding the question now is, that <i>two negatives are equivalent
to an affirmative</i>, denying each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, if two negatives are found together, it is a sign of
ignorance or carelessness, or else a purpose to make an affirmative
effect. In the latter case, one of the negatives is often a prefix;
as <i>in</i>frequent, <i>un</i>common.</p>

that is, if the last precedes a verb, the first ought to be placed
before a verb; if the second precedes a phrase, the first should
also. <a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>This is necessary to

changed to <i>not</i> ... <i>either</i>,&mdash;"I am not in spirits
<i>either</i> to enjoy it, <i>or</i> to reply to it."</p>
<p>Besides <i>neither ... or</i>, even <i>neither ... nor</i> is
often changed to <i>not</i>&mdash;<i>either ... or</i> with
advantage, as the negation is sometimes too far from the verb to
which it belongs.</p>
<p>A noun may be preceded by one of the correlatives, and an
equivalent pronoun by the other. The sentence, "This loose and
inaccurate manner of speaking has misled us <i>both</i> in the

<p><span class="sn"><b>458.</b></span> As to the placing of a
preposition after its object in certain cases, see Sec. 305.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Between <i>and</i> among.</div>
<p><span class="sn"><b>459.</b></span> In the primary meaning of
<b>between</b> and <b>among</b> there is a sharp distinction, as
already seen in Sec. 313; but in Modern English the difference is
not so marked.</p>
<p><b>Between</b> is used most often with two things only, but
still it is frequently used in speaking of several objects, some
relation or connection between two at a time being implied.</p>
<p><b>Among</b> is used in the same way as <i>amid</i> (though not
with exactly the same meaning), several objects being spoken of in
the aggregate, no separation or division by twos being implied.</p>
<p>Examples of the distinctive use of the two words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="sidenote"><i>Two things.</i></div>
<div class="blockquot">

<div class="sidenote"><i>Two groups or one and a group.</i></div>

<p>Some of them have, by custom, come to take prepositions not in
keeping with the original meaning of the words. Such are
<i>derogatory</i>, <i>averse</i>.</p>
<p>Many words take one preposition to express one meaning, and

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
